  "reading_english": "RULES OF SOUND (Page 6)\n\n1. THE HARD SOUNDS: Greek has no single letter for B, D, G (hard). \n   - We combine letters to make them.\n   - M + Pi = B (Mpala -> Bala)\n   - N + Tau = D (Ntomata -> Domata)\n   - Gamma + Kappa = G (Gkol -> Gol)\n\n2. THE 'I' SOUND: Greek is famous for having many ways to write 'i'.\n   - Iota (ι)\n   - Eta (η)\n   - Upsilon (υ)\n   - Epsilon-Iota (ει)\n   - Omicron-Iota (οι)\n   All sound exactly the same: 'ee'.\n\n3. THE 'U' SOUND: To make the sound 'oo' (moon), you MUST write 'ΟΥ'.",
  "audio_script": "This is a crucial lesson. Digraphs! \n\nIn English, 'Ph' makes an 'F' sound. In Greek, we do this a lot.\n\nKey Pairs:\n- Mu + Pi (Μπ) sounds like 'B'. 'Mpala' is pronounced 'Bala'.\n- Nu + Tau (Ντ) sounds like 'D'. 'Ntomata' is pronounced 'Domata'.\n\nAlso, Vowels:\n- 'Ou' (Omicron Upsilon) is the ONLY way to write the sound 'oo'.\n- 'Ai' (Alpha Iota) sounds like 'E' (as in 'Met'). 'Nai' (Yes) rhymes with 'Day' shortened.\n\nMastering these 4-5 combinations unlocks 90% of Greek reading.",
