  "reading_english": "According to the book (Chapter 3.3):\n\n1. the street -> the streets\n2. the man -> the men\n3. the map -> the maps\n4. the hour -> the hours\n5. the belt -> the belts\n\nIn the plural, the article of masculine nouns in the nominative is now identical to the article of feminine nouns: οι.",
  "audio_script": "Hello! I am your Greek tutor. Let's look at how we change the definite article from singular to plural... This is covered in Chapter 3, Section 3.3 of your notes... \n\nIn English, you just use 'the' for everything. But in Greek, we have to change the article. For masculine nouns, the singular 'o' becomes 'oi' in the plural. This is written with the letters omicron and iota... but it is pronounced simply as 'ee'...\n\nListen to these examples from Table 3.4... 'o dromos', the street, becomes 'oi dromoi'... 'o andras', the man, becomes 'oi andres'... and 'o khartis', the map, becomes 'oi khartes'...\n\nNow, here is a very interesting tip from page 54... In the nominative plural, the masculine and feminine articles actually merge. They become identical! So, the feminine singular 'ee', written with the letter eta, also becomes 'oi'... written with omicron-iota...\n\nFor example: 'ee ora', the hour, becomes 'oi ores'... and 'ee zoni', the belt, becomes 'oi zones'...\n\nSo remember: whether it was a masculine 'o' or a feminine 'ee' in the singular... in the plural, they both become 'oi'. Practice saying 'oi' just like the English letter 'E'... but remember to write it as omicron-iota!"
