  "audio_script": "Hello there! Welcome to your very first Greek lesson. Today, we're going to dive into the very foundation of the Greek language: its alphabet. Specifically, we'll cover the first part of the alphabet, from Alpha to Xi, focusing on how to pronounce and write these letters. This is crucial for reading and speaking Greek!\n\nLet's start with the first letter, Alpha, written as Α in capital and α in small. It makes the 'a' sound, just like in the English word 'hat'. So, Α/α sounds like [a].\n\nNext, we have Beta, written as Β/β. Now, be careful here! This is not a 'b' sound. In Greek, Β/β sounds like 'v', as in the English word 'vase'. So, Β/β is [v].\n\nMoving on to Gamma, written as Γ/γ. This sound doesn't have a direct equivalent in English. It's a bit like the 'g' sound, but softer, produced further back in your throat. Imagine the 'g' in 'go', but more guttural. The textbook suggests listening to the initial sound of the French word 'rendez-vous' for a close approximation. So, Γ/γ is a unique sound, [γ].\n\nThen comes Delta, written as Δ/δ. This is similar to the 'th' sound in the English word 'than'. So, Δ/δ is [δ].\n\nEpsilon, written as Ε/ε, makes the 'e' sound, just like in the English word 'pen'. So, Ε/ε is [e].\n\nNext is Zeta, written as Ζ/ζ. This is straightforward, it sounds like 'z', as in the English word 'zoo'. So, Ζ/ζ is [z].\n\nNow, for Eta, written as Η/η. This letter also makes the 'ee' sound, similar to the 'i' in 'tip'. So, Η/η is [i].\n\nWe then have Theta, written as Θ/θ. This is the unvoiced 'th' sound, like in the English word 'thin'. So, Θ/θ is [θ].\n\nFollowing Theta is Iota, written as Ι/ι. Interestingly, just like Eta, Iota also makes the 'ee' sound, like in 'tip'. So, Ι/ι is also [i]. Yes, that means two different letters, Η/η and Ι/ι, represent the exact same sound! We'll explore why later, but for now, just remember both make an [i] sound.\n\nKappa, written as Κ/κ, makes a 'k' sound. The book notes it's an unaspirated 'k', which means you don't release a puff of air. It's close to the 'k' in 'book'. So, Κ/κ is [k].\n\nLambda, written as Λ/λ, is the Greek 'l' sound. It's described as a 'light l', similar to the 'l' in 'like', not the darker 'l' in 'little'. So, Λ/λ is [l].\n\nAnd finally, for this section, Mu, written as Μ/μ. This is your familiar 'm' sound, like in 'make'. So, Μ/μ is [m].\n\nWe also have Xi, written as Ξ/ξ. This represents a double consonant sound, 'ks', just like in the English word 'ox'. So, Ξ/ξ is [ks].\n\nRemember to practice these sounds. You can go back and listen to them again. Mastering the alphabet is the first, most important step to unlocking the Greek language!"
