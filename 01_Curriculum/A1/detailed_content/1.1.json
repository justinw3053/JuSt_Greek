  "audio_script": "Καλημέρα! Welcome to your first Greek lesson. I am your tutor, and I expect your full attention and effort. Today, we begin with the very foundation: The Greek Alphabet. We will focus on the first twelve letters, from Alpha to Mu. Pay close attention to the sounds and how they are written.\n\nLet's start. First, we have **Α/α**... The letter Alpha, A/α, represents a short 'a' sound, just like in the English word 'hat'. In Modern Greek, we do not have long vowels, so keep it short and crisp. This sound, [a], will be a foundation as we introduce other consonants.\n\nNext, **Β/β**... Now, this is crucial. Β/β is *not* the 'b' sound you might expect from English. It is a 'v' sound, as in 'vase'. Remember this, it is a common point of confusion for beginners.\n\nMoving on, **Γ/γ**... This sound has no direct equivalent in English. It is a softer sound, closer to the 'r' in the French word 'rendez-vous'. Try to replicate that gentle, almost guttural sound. When writing the small letter, Γ/γ, notice that the typing font has no inner space at the bottom.\n\nThen, **Δ/δ**... This letter represents the 'th' sound in 'than'. It is a voiced sound, unlike its counterpart Θ/θ which we will see shortly. Practice placing your tongue for this sound.\n\nNow, **Ε/ε**... E/ε stands for the 'e' sound, like in 'pen'. Simple and straightforward.\n\nNext is **Ζ/ζ**... This one should be easy. The capital letter looks like the English 'Z', and it represents the 'z' sound, as in 'zoo'. When writing the small letter, first draw a horizontal line, then continue with a final 's' shape.\n\nMoving on to **Η/η**... The letter H/η represents a short 'i' sound, like in 'tip'. This is the first of several letters that will represent the *same* 'i' sound. Keep this in mind for spelling later.\n\nThen, **Θ/θ**... This letter stands for the 'th' sound, like in 'thin'. Unlike Δ/δ, this is a voiceless sound. Compare them: [δ] in 'than' versus [θ] in 'thin'.\n\nNext, **Ι/ι**... And here is the second representation for that 'i' sound, again, like in 'tip'. So, Η/η and Ι/ι represent *exactly* the same sound now. Why two different letters? Because in Ancient Greek, they had distinct sounds. Modern Greek preserves the writing, even though the phonetic difference is gone. Also, when writing the small letter, Ι/ι, remember it has *no dot* on top, unlike the Latin 'i'.\n\nNow, **Κ/κ**... This letter stands for an unaspirated 'k' sound, close to the 'k' in 'book'. It's not like the 'k' in 'kite' which has a puff of air.\n\nNext, **Λ/λ**... Here we have an 'l' sound. It is closer to the 'light l' in 'like', not the 'dark l' you find at the end of words like 'little' in English.\n\nAnd finally for today, **Μ/μ**... It is easy to relate the capital M to an 'm' sound, like in 'make'. To write the small letter, first draw a vertical line, then something similar to the Latin 'u'.\n\nTo summarize a few common pitfalls for these letters: Remember that **Β/β** is [v], not [b]. **Η/η** is [i], not an English 'h'. And **Ι/ι** in small form has no dot. Your memory is key here. Practice these sounds diligently. Repeat them until they become second nature. We will build upon this foundation next time. Any questions? If not, practice!",
