  "reading_english": "GENDER RULES [(See Page 22)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=22)\n\n1. THE BIG THREE: Every noun MUST be Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter.\n2. THE ARTICLE IS KING: Don't guess gender. Look at the word 'the'.\n   - 'O' = Masculine\n   - 'H' (ee) = Feminine\n   - 'To' = Neuter\n3. FALSE FRIENDS: \n   - Chairs (karekla) are Feminine.\n   - Girls (koritsi) are Neuter (grammatically 'small thing').\n   - Coffee (kafes) is Masculine.\n\n4. LOANWORD RULE [(See Page 24)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=24): Foreign words usually become NEUTER (to computer, to festival). Unless they sound Greek (Pizza -> Pitsa -> H Pitsa).",
  "audio_script": "Gender! Page 22. This is the most important concept in nouns. \n\nIn English, a chair is 'it'. In Greek, a chair is 'She' (H Karekla).\nIn English, a book is 'it'. In Greek, a book is 'It' (To Vivlio).\nIn English, a coffee is 'it'. In Greek, a coffee is 'He' (O Kafes).\n\nHow do you know? Look at the Article (The).\n- Masculine: O\n- Feminine: H (Eta)\n- Neuter: To\n\nLoanwords like 'Computer' or 'Festival' don't fit the Greek patterns, so they are almost always NEUTER. 'To Computer'. But 'Pizza' ends in 'a', so it becomes Feminine: 'H Pitsa'.",
