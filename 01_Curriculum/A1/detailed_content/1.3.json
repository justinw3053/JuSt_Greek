  "audio_script": "Χαίρετε, students! Welcome back to our Modern Greek journey. Today, we put our alphabet knowledge to the test with some essential reading practice: transliterating names and cities. Remember what our textbook says on page 1? 'All you have to do is learn what each letter (or combination of letters) of the Greek alphabet represents, and then put things together in practice.' That's exactly what we'll do! No new rules, just application.\n\nLet's start with our first word...\n\n**1. Αθήνα**\n\nThis is 'Athens'. Let's break it down. \n\nWe begin with 'Α' which, from Table 1.1 on page 2, you know represents the short [a] sound, like in 'hat'. \nThen comes 'θ', which is [θ], like in 'thin'. \nNext, 'η', which is [i], like in 'tip' – remember, we have several letters for the [i] sound. \nFinally, 'ν' for [n], like in 'noise', followed by 'α' again for [a]. \n\nSo, put it together: Α-θή-να. The accent mark on the 'η' tells us the stress falls there: [aˈθina]. \n\nExcellent. Moving on...\n\n**2. Πέτρος**\n\nThis is a common Greek name, 'Peter'. Let’s read it together.\n\n'Π' is an unaspirated [p] sound, like in 'stop', as per Table 1.1.\n'έ' is [e], like in 'pen'. \nThe combination 'τρ' is simply [tr]. \n'ο' is a short [o], like in 'top'. \nAnd 'ς', at the end of a word, is [s], like in 'see'. \n\nSo we have: Πέ-τρος. The accent mark on the 'έ' shows the stress: [ˈpetros]. \n\nVery good. Next name...\n\n**3. Ελένη**\n\nThis is 'Helen'. Pay close attention to the sounds.\n\n'Ε' is [e], like in 'pen'. \n'λ' is the light [l] of 'like'. \n'έ' is [e] again. \nAnd 'νη' is [ni], with 'η' being [i]. \n\nSo, Ε-λέ-νη. Stress on the second 'έ': [eˈleni]. You are doing well.\n\nNow for a slightly more complex name from page 8 of our text...\n\n**4. Αντώνης**\n\nThis is 'Antonis'. Remember the special consonant combinations from section 1.4.1?\n\n'Α' is [a]. \nThe combination 'ντ' represents the [d] sound, like in 'door'. This is important! Not [nt], but [d] at the beginning or within a word. \n'ώ' is a short [o], like in 'top'. \n'ν' is [n]. \n'η' is [i]. \nAnd 'ς' is [s]. \n\nSo: Αν-τώ-νης. The stress is on the 'ώ': [anˈdonis]. \n\nDon't forget those special consonant groups! Now, let's try a country...\n\n**5. Ελλάδα**\n\nThis is 'Greece', our beloved country!\n\n'Ε' is [e]. \n'λλ' is a combination of two identical consonants. As mentioned on page 7, 'combinations of two identical consonants are pronounced exactly like the single consonant version'. So, it's just a single [l] sound.\n'ά' is [a]. \n'δ' is [δ], like in 'than'. \nAnd finally, 'α' is [a]. \n\nSo: Ελ-λά-δα. Stress on the 'ά': [eˈlaða]. \n\nAnd for our final practice word...\n\n**6. Κρήτη**\n\nThis is the beautiful island of 'Crete'.\n\n'Κ' is an unaspirated [k] sound, close to 'book'. \n'ρ' is the rolled [r], like in Spanish 'Roberto' (remember page 3?). \n'ή' is [i]. \n'τ' is an unaspirated [t] sound, like in 'spot'. \nAnd 'η' is [i] again. \n\nSo, Κρή-τη. The stress is on the 'ή': [ˈkriti]. \n\nBravo! You've just transliterated your first Greek names and cities. The key is to remember each letter and combination's unique sound, apply the stress, and then put it all together. Keep practicing these, and refer back to Table 1.1 and sections 1.4.1 and 1.4.2 in your textbook. The more you read, the more natural it becomes. We will build on this next time. Αντίο!"
