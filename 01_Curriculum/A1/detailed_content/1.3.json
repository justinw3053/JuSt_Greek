  "reading_english": "**Reference**: [(See Page 2)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=2)\n\nSTRESS RULES (From Page 6)\n\n1. Dynamic Stress: Stress is not fixed. It can be on any of the last 3 syllables.\n2. The Accent Mark: In lowercase, the mark (΄) tells you EXACTLY where to put the stress. It is obligatory.\n3. Meaning Change: Changing stress changes meaning! \n   - pote (when) vs poTE (never).\n   - oMOS (raw) vs Omos (shoulder).\n\nTRANSLITERATION NOTES\n\n- Αθήνα: Note the 'η' (i) sound.\n- Πέτρος: Note the rolled 'ρ'.\n- Αντώνης: 'ντ' at the start or middle is [d] or [nd].\n- Ελλάδα: Double 'λλ' is just a single [l] sound.\n- Κρήτη: Both 'η' are [i].",
  "audio_script": "Exercise Time! Open your Grammar Notes to Page 5. \n\nLet's start with Drill 1: Short Words. \n- 'Με' (me - with), 'Μα' (ma - but), 'Μη' (mi - don't).\n- 'Σε' (se - to you), 'Ας' (as - let).\n\nNow proper reading in Drill 4. \n- Αθήνα: The stress is on the 'i'. Not A-the-na, but A-thi-na.\n- Πέτρος: Stress the first syllable. PE-tros.\n\nNow the most important concept: STRESS (Page 6).\nListen carefully: 'PO-te' means 'When'. 'Po-TE' means 'Never'.\nIf you say 'When I go to Greece' but use 'Never', people will be confused! \nStress is not decoration. It is meaning.",
