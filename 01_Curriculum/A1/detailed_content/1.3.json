  "audio_script": "Hello! Welcome to your next Greek lesson. Today, we're going to focus on reading practice, specifically how to approach transliterating names and cities, building on what we learned about the Greek alphabet in Chapter 1. This is a crucial skill for both understanding and being understood!\n\nLet's start by revisiting some of the key Greek letters and sounds. Remember, the Greek alphabet has 24 letters, each with a capital and a small version. We'll go through a few important ones and their sounds...\n\n(Pause)\n\nFirst, we have A/α, which sounds like the 'a' in 'hat'.\n\nNext, B/β. This is not a 'b' sound, but a 'v' sound, like in 'vase'.\n\nThen, Γ/γ. This sound doesn't have a direct English equivalent. It's often described as a guttural sound, similar to the 'ch' in the Scottish word 'loch' or the Spanish 'j' in 'jamón'.\n\nΔ/δ makes a 'th' sound, like in 'than'.\n\nE/ε sounds like the 'e' in 'pen'.\n\nZ/ζ is like the 'z' in 'zoo'.\n\nH/η and Ι/ι both represent the 'i' sound, like in 'tip'. It's important to remember there are multiple ways to write the same vowel sound in Greek.\n\nΘ/θ makes the 'th' sound, as in 'thin'.\n\nK/κ is the 'k' sound, similar to 'book', but it's unaspirated.\n\nΛ/λ is like the English 'l', similar to the 'l' in 'like'.\n\nM/μ is straightforward, like the 'm' in 'make'.\n\nN/ν is like the 'n' in 'noise'.\n\nΞ/ξ is a double consonant sound, 'ks', like in 'ox'.\n\nO/ο is the 'o' sound, like in 'top'.\n\nΠ/π is the 'p' sound, like in 'stop', but also unaspirated.\n\nP/ρ is a rolled 'r' sound, similar to the Spanish or Italian 'r'.\n\nΣ/σ (-ς) is the 's' sound, like in 'see'. Remember, it changes to -ς at the end of a word.\n\nT/τ is the 't' sound, like in 'spot', and it's also unaspirated.\n\nY/υ also represents the 'i' sound, like in 'tip'.\n\nΦ/φ is the 'f' sound, like in 'fish'.\n\nX/χ is another guttural sound, like the 'ch' in 'loch' or the Spanish 'j'.\n\nΨ/ψ is another double consonant sound, 'ps', like in 'stops'.\n\nAnd finally, Ω/ω, which also represents the 'o' sound, like in 'top'.\n\n(Pause)\n\nNow, let's look at some combinations of letters that create new sounds, especially for consonants.\n\nThe combination 'μπ' gives us the 'b' sound, like in 'book'.\n\n'ντ' gives us the 'd' sound, like in 'door'.\n\n'γκ' or 'γγ' gives us the 'g' sound, like in 'gum'.\n\n'τσ' makes a 'ts' sound.\n\n'τζ' makes a 'dz' sound.\n\n(Pause)\n\nWe also have combinations for vowels. Remember, [a] is usually 'α', [e] can be 'ε' or 'αι', [i] can be 'η', 'ι', 'υ', 'ει', or 'οι', [o] can be 'ο' or 'ω', and [u] is usually 'ου'.\n\nThere are also some tricky vowel combinations like 'αι', 'αυ', and 'ευ'. For example, 'αι' can be pronounced as [ai] if it has a double dot over the 'ι', as in 'παιδάκι' (paidáki - little child) versus 'παϊδάκι' (païdáki - lamb chop). This changes the meaning!\n\nFor 'αυ' and 'ευ', the 'υ' often acts like a consonant. It's a [v] sound if followed by a voiced sound, like in 'αυγό' (avgó - egg), and an [f] sound if followed by a voiceless sound, like in 'αυτός' (aftós - this).\n\n(Pause)\n\nNow, let's put this knowledge into practice with some reading examples. The book provides many short words and longer words to help you get comfortable. Let's look at a few...\n\n(Example 1a)\n'με' (me), 'μα' (ma), 'μη' (mi), 'σε' (se), 'ας' (as), 'πας' (pas), 'φας' (fas), 'πες' (pes), 'δες' (des), 'λες' (les).\nJust focus on the sounds here, not the meaning yet.\n\n(Example 1b)\n'ΝΑ' (NA), 'ΑΝ' (AN), 'ΘΑ' (THA), 'ΤΑ' (TA), 'ΖΩ' (ZO), 'ΔΕΝ' (DEN), 'ΠΩΣ' (POS).\nNotice the capital letters here are just for emphasis in the text.\n\n(Example 6)\n'έλα' (ela), 'από' (apo), 'νερό' (nero), 'βάζω' (vazo), 'μαμά' (mama), 'θέλω' (thelo), 'δίνω' (dino), 'θύμα' (thima), 'φυτό' (fyto), 'ξέρω' (xero), 'ψάρι' (psari), 'πάμε' (pame), 'χαρά' (hara), 'τώρα' (tora), 'όταν' (otan).\nTry to sound these out. Remember the stress marks!\n\n(Example 7)\nHere we have pairs of words that look and sound similar but have different meanings due to stress: 'νόμος' (nómos - law) vs. 'νομός' (nomós - prefecture), 'μόνος' (mónos - alone) vs. 'μονός' (monós - odd), 'χάλι' (cháli - rug) vs. 'χαλί' (chalí - carpet).\nIt's crucial to get the stress right to convey the correct meaning.\n\n(Pause)\n\nLet's try a slightly longer sentence now. This sentence uses names and a city name. Pay attention to how the letters combine.\n\n(Example: Ο Πέτρος είναι από την Αθήνα.)\n\nLet's break this down: 'Ο' (O) is the article 'the'. 'Πέτρος' (Petros) is a common male name. 'είναι' (íne) means 'is'. 'από' (apó) means 'from'. And 'την Αθήνα' (tin Athína) means 'Athens'.\n\nWhen we put it all together, it sounds like this: [o petros íne apó tin athína].\n\nNotice how some sounds blend together at the boundaries of words, like 'από την' becoming 'απο την' [apó tin]. This is a natural part of spoken Greek.\n\nPractice reading these words and sentences aloud. Focus on the individual sounds and the stress. The more you practice, the more comfortable you'll become with reading and understanding Greek.\n\nRemember, the key to transliterating names and cities is to apply the pronunciation rules for each Greek letter and combination consistently. We'll continue building on this in our future lessons. Keep up the great work!"
