  "audio_script": "Welcome to Week 1. Today we are focusing on Reading Practice and Transliterating names and cities. ... Because English and Greek share some letters, we can often guess how proper names are spelled. ... Listen closely to the names in this short passage. ... Ο Γιώργος είναι στην Αθήνα. Η Μαρία είναι στην Κρήτη. Ο Γιάννης είναι από τη Θεσσαλονίκη. ... That was: George is in Athens. Maria is in Crete. Giannis is from Thessaloniki. ... Now, listen and repeat the Greek text after me. Pay attention to the capital letters. ... Ο Γιώργος. ... Η Μαρία. ... Η Αθήνα. ... Η Κρήτη. ... Η Θεσσαλονίκη. ... Great job. These are very common Greek names and cities. Practice recognizing them on your own."
