(I want two waters = two bottles).\n\nSHOPPING LIST (Plurals Review)\n- Δύο καφέδες (Masc: Kafes -> Kafedes)\n- Τρεις πίτσες (Fem: Pitsa -> Pitses)\n- Τέσσερα καλαμάκια (Neut: Kalamaki -> Kalamakia - Straws/Skewers)\n\nPRICING QUESTIONS\n- Πόσο κάνει; (How much does it make/cost? - Singular)\n- Πόσο κάνουν; (How much do they cost? - Plural)",
  "reading_english": "GRAMMAR: COUNTING & PRICES (Page 46)\n\n1. UNCOUNTABLES: Words like Water (Nero), Coffee (Kafes), Cheese (Tyri).\n   - Usually Singular. \n   - But in ordering, we pluralize them to mean 'portions' or 'bottles'.\n   - 'Dyo kafedes' = Two coffees.\n\n2. HOW MUCH?: Use the verb 'Kano' (To do/make).\n   - Posso kanei? (Singular)\n   - Posso kanoun? (Plural)\n\n3. LOANWORDS: Some words don't change!\n   - To toast -> Ta toast.\n   - To computer -> Ta computer.",
  "audio_script": "Let's go shopping. \n\nWhen you order, you often turn uncountable things (like coffee) into countable things (cups of coffee).\n\n'Enan kafe' (One coffee - Accusative Masc).\n'Dyo kafedes' (Two coffees). Note the -es ending for nouns in -es.\n\n'Ena nero' (One water).\n'Dyo nera' (Two waters).\n\nAnd asking for the price:\nUse 'Posso kanei' for one thing. \nUse 'Posso kanoun' for many things. \n\nTip: 'Kalamaki' means 'Small reed'. In Athens, it's a straw. It's also a meat skewer (Souvlaki). \n'Dyo kalamakia' = Two straws OR Two skewers. Context is key!",
