  "audio_script": "Hello. Today we are looking at Interrogatives, the words we use to ask questions. Pay close attention to the Greek interrogation mark, which looks like an English semicolon... (;). First, let's look at 'Who'. According to Chapter 6.3, 'Who' is a pronoun that changes based on gender. We use 'Ποιος' for masculine and 'Ποια' for feminine. For example: 'Ποιος είναι ο Πέτρος;' or 'Ποια είναι η Ελένη;'. Next is 'What'. The word is 'Τι'. As seen in our 'Craving for Meaning' section in Chapter 3, we ask 'Τι σημαίνει;' to find out the meaning of a word. 'Τι' is invariable, meaning it does not change form. Moving on to 'When', we use 'Πότε'. We saw this in Unit 3.2.5 regarding time. 'Πότε φεύγεις;' means 'When are you leaving?'. We can also use 'Τι' to ask about the day: 'Τι μέρα είναι σήμερα;'. Finally, for 'Where', we use 'Πού' with an accent mark. This helps us identify location, often involving the prepositional phrases we studied in Chapter 3.2.4, like 'Πού μένει ο Πέτρος;'. Remember, in Greek, intonation is also key. A statement like 'Βρέχει' becomes a question 'Βρέχει;' simply by raising your voice at the end. Practice these forms carefully."
