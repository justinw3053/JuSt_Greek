  "audio_script": "Welcome to Week 12. Today we will review cases: Nominative and Accusative. ... In Greek, the form of a noun or pronoun changes depending on its function in a sentence. ... The Nominative case is usually the subject of the sentence. ... The Accusative case is usually the direct object. ... Let's read a short passage. ... [Reading Greek]: Ο μαθητής διαβάζει το βιβλίο. ... Η μαθήτρια γράφει την άσκηση. ... Ο δάσκαλος βλέπει τον μαθητή. ... Η δασκάλα βλέπει την μαθήτρια. ... In the first sentence, 'Ο μαθητής' (the male student) is the subject, so it's in the Nominative case. 'το βιβλίο' (the book) is the direct object, so it's in the Accusative case. ... In the second sentence, 'Η μαθήτρια' (the female student) is the subject, Nominative. 'την άσκηση' (the exercise) is the direct object, Accusative. ... In the third sentence, 'Ο δάσκαλος' (the male teacher) is the subject, Nominative. 'τον μαθητή' (the male student) is the direct object, Accusative. ... And in the last sentence, 'Η δασκάλα' (the female teacher) is the subject, Nominative. 'την μαθήτρια' (the female student) is the direct object, Accusative. ... Notice how the endings change for masculine and feminine nouns in the Accusative case. ... Great job! Let's practice more next time."
