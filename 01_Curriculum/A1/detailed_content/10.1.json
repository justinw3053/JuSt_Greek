  "audio_script": "Welcome to Week 10... Today we will learn about the Subject vs Object in Greek... Remember, the Subject is who or what is doing the action... and the Object is who or what is receiving the action... Listen to this: [Reading Greek] Ο Γιάννης διαβάζει το βιβλίο... Η Μαρία βλέπει τον Γιάννη... Το παιδί παίζει με την μπάλα... Now, let's break it down... In the first sentence, 'Ο Γιάννης' is the Subject... he is doing the reading... 'το βιβλίο' is the Object... it is being read... See how 'Ο Γιάννης' is in the Nominative case, without a preposition... but 'το βιβλίο' is in the Accusative case, also without a preposition... In the second sentence, 'Η Μαρία' is the Subject... she is doing the seeing... and 'τον Γιάννη' is the Object... he is being seen... Notice how 'Η Μαρία' is Nominative, and 'τον Γιάννη' is Accusative... and 'τον' is used because it's a masculine noun... In the third sentence, 'Το παιδί' is the Subject... it is doing the playing... and 'την μπάλα' is the Object... it is being played with... 'Το παιδί' is Nominative... and 'την μπάλα' is Accusative... You'll see this pattern a lot... The Subject is usually in the Nominative case... and the direct Object is usually in the Accusative case... This is a fundamental concept in Greek grammar... Keep practicing and you'll get it!"
