  "audio_script": "Hello! Welcome to our Greek lesson today. We're going to explore prepositions, which are essential for building more complex sentences. Think of them as glue that connects different parts of a sentence, telling us about relationships like location, direction, or time.\n\nLet's start with some examples from our textbook. Listen carefully.\n\nOur first example uses the preposition **από** (apo). It means 'from'. The sentence is: 'O Πέτρος είναι **από** την Ιταλία.' ... This translates to 'Peter is from Italy.' ... Here, 'από' tells us Peter's origin.\n\nNext, we have the preposition **για** (gia), which means 'for'. The sentence is: 'Το βιβλίο είναι **για** τη Μαρία.' ... 'The book is for Maria.' ... This shows us who the book is intended for.\n\nNow, let's look at **σε** (se). This preposition is very common and can mean 'to', 'at', or 'in'. It often combines with articles. For instance, 'Mένω **στην** Ελλάδα.' ... 'I live in Greece.' ... The word 'στην' is actually a combination of 'σε' and the feminine definite article 'την'. It shows that Greece is where I live.\n\nAnother important preposition is **με** (me), meaning 'with'. Our example is: 'O Γιάννης μένει **με** τον Πέτρο.' ... 'John lives with Peter.' ... 'Με' clearly indicates companionship.\n\nPrepositions also help us with direction or indirect objects. Take the sentence: 'Δίνω ένα βιβλίο **στον** Πέτρο.' ... 'I give a book to Peter.' ... Here, 'στον' is a contraction of 'σε' and the masculine accusative article 'τον'. It shows where the book is going.\n\nAnd one more for 'at' or 'in': 'Eίμαι **στο** σχολείο.' ... 'I am at school.' ... 'Στο' is a contraction of 'σε' and the neuter article 'το'.\n\nIt's helpful to memorize some common prepositions. Let's quickly review them:\n\n**από** (apo) - from...\n**με** (me) - with...\n**για** (gia) - for...\n**σε** (se) - to, at, in...\n**προς** (pros) - towards...\n**χωρίς** (choris) - without...\n\nUnderstanding these prepositions will significantly help you build more descriptive and accurate sentences in Greek. Practice using them, and you'll see how much clearer your communication becomes!"
