  "audio_script": "Kalimera, my dear student! Welcome back to our Modern Greek lesson. Today, we continue our journey through the Greek alphabet, picking up from where we left off. We'll cover the remaining letters from Ν to Ω, and then delve into some crucial vowel combinations, what your textbook sometimes calls 'diphthongs'. Let us begin, without delay!\n\nFirst, the individual letters, starting on Page 3, Table 1.1 of your textbook:\n\n**Ν/ν**: This letter stands for the [n] sound, just like in the English word 'noise'. A straightforward sound. Do not confuse its small-letter version with the Latin 'v'. Listen carefully: νερό 'water', νόμος 'law'.\n\n**Ο/ο**: This letter represents a short [o] sound, like in the English word 'top'. Pay attention to its shortness. For example: φοράω 'I wear', όσα 'as many as'.\n\n**Π/π**: This is an unaspirated [p] sound, similar to the 'p' in 'stop' in English. It's not a strong puff of air. Listen: πάω 'I go', ποτήρι 'glass'.\n\n**Ρ/ρ**: Ah, the Greek 'rho'! This sound is significantly different from the English 'r'. It's closer to the rolled 'r' in Italian or Spanish, like in 'Roberto'. To produce it, the tip of your tongue must take a frontal position and loosely touch the area over your upper teeth. Listen and try: ρωτάω 'I ask', ράφι 'shelf'. And remember, as your textbook notes, Ρ/ρ is clearly not the Latin 'P/p'.\n\n**Σ/σ (-ς)**: This letter represents an [s] sound, like in 'see'. Notice that it has two small-letter versions. When the 's' sound is at the very end of a word, it is written as -ς. In all other positions, it is written as σ. For example: σκληρός 'hard', θάλασσα 'sea', σμήνος 'swarm'. Now, your textbook also mentions an important detail on Page 7: Σ/σ is usually [s] among vowels, but it can represent a [z] sound when followed by [m] or [v]. Listen to these nuances: άσε 'leave (imperative)', στάση 'stop'.\n\n**Τ/τ**: This letter stands for an unaspirated [t] sound, like the 't' in 'spot' in English. No strong aspiration. For example: τώρα 'now', τρία 'three'. A common mistake, highlighted on Page 4, is drawing the small-letter 'τ' with a vertical line exceeding the horizontal line like the Latin 't'. The Greek 'τ' is simpler, contained.\n\n**Υ/υ**: This is the third representation of the short [i] sound, just like η and ι. Yes, three ways to write the same sound! Examples: ύψος 'height', κύμα 'wave'. And again, be careful with writing: the small-letter 'υ' has a circular bottom and no additional line like the Latin 'u'. If you make it angular, it becomes 'ν' ([n]), which is a different letter entirely! Also, do not confuse it with the Latin 'Y'.\n\n**Φ/φ**: This letter stands for the [f] sound, like in 'fish'. Simple enough, yes? Listen: φίλος 'friend', φυτό 'plant'.\n\n**Χ/χ**: This sound, represented by Χ/χ, has no direct English equivalent. Your textbook describes it as close to the 'ch' in Scottish 'loch' or the 'j' in Spanish 'jamón'. It is a guttural sound. Listen carefully and practice: χαλί 'rug', χαρά 'joy'. And remember, Χ/χ stands for [h], not the Latin 'X'.\n\n**Ψ/ψ**: This letter represents a double consonant, namely [ps], similar to the sound at the end of the English word 'stops'. Listen: ψάρι 'fish', ψάχνω 'I search'.\n\n**Ω/ω**: This is the final letter of the Greek alphabet. Ω/ω also represents the short [o] sound, just like Ο/ο. Two letters for one sound! This is part of what makes Greek spelling 'tricky', as the textbook calls it. For example: ώρα 'hour', ωμός 'raw'.\n\nNow, let's move to the important section 1.4.2 in your textbook, 'More Sounds', specifically on Vowels. Here we find combinations of letters that form single sounds.\n\n**ου**: This combination represents the [u] sound, like in the English word 'foot'. This is our only new vowel sound introduced by a combination. Listen: ουρά 'tail', ουρανός 'sky', κουλούρι 'koulouri'.\n\n**ει**: This combination is another way to write the [i] sound. By now, you have 'η', 'ι', 'υ', and now 'ει' all representing [i]! Examples: είμαι 'I am', κάνει 'it does/makes', παίζω 'I play'.\n\n**οι**: And yes, another one! The combination 'οι' also represents the [i] sound. So now we have five ways to write [i]! 'η', 'ι', 'υ', 'ει', 'οι'. You must commit these to memory! Listen: οικονομία 'economy', ώμοι 'shoulders', ποιός 'who'.\n\n**αι**: This combination represents the [e] sound, like in the English word 'pen'. So, ε and αι both sound like [e]. Examples: αίμα 'blood', παιδάκι 'little child', παίζω 'I play'.\n\nYes, a bit much to remember with the multiple representations for [i] and [o], but you will master it with practice!\n\nNow, pay close attention to 'The Double Dot' section on Page 9 of your textbook. This little mark, called 'διαλυτικά' (dialytiká), is crucial. It indicates that two vowels that would normally combine into a single sound, should be pronounced separately. For instance, without the double dot, 'αι' is [e]. But with it, as in παϊδάκι, it's [ai]. This changes the meaning entirely! Contrast: παιδάκι 'little child' versus παϊδάκι 'lamb chop'. The double dot is not decoration!\n\nAnd now, for what your textbook calls 'Two Tricky Combinations': αυ and ευ. These are indeed tricky, so listen carefully! Here, the letter Υ/υ does *not* stand for a vowel, but for a consonant. And to make it even more challenging, this consonant may be pronounced as [v] or [f] depending on the sound that follows it. It's [v] when followed by a voiced sound (vowels, or consonants like [l], [r]). It's [f] when followed by a voiceless sound (consonants like [t], [k], [x]). Listen: αυγό 'egg', αυλή 'yard' (with [v] sound). Compare to: αυτός 'he/this', ευκολία 'ease' (with [f] sound).\n\nFinally, a peculiar stress rule for αυ/ευ. If the combination is stressed, the accent mark falls on the υ, even though it represents a consonant here. For instance: αύριο 'tomorrow', εύκολος 'easy'. This is an exception you must remember.\n\nPhew! That was a lot, wasn't it? But you are doing well. Remember, reading and *listening* are key. Take your time with the examples in the textbook, repeat them. Don't just look at the letters; *hear* the sounds. This is fundamental for your journey into Modern Greek. Well done for today. Your homework is to diligently review these letters and combinations, focusing on accurate pronunciation. Next time, we will tackle stress in more detail and begin putting these sounds into words!
