  "reading_greek": "Ν/ν, Ξ/ξ, Ο/ο, Π/π, Ρ/ρ, Σ/σ (-ς), Τ/τ, Υ/υ, Φ/φ, Χ/χ, Ψ/ψ, Ω/ω\n\nCommon Mistakes in Absolute-Beginner Writing\n• The small-letter version of Υ/υ has no additional line like the Latin u. And its bottom is circular, not angular. If you make it angular what you will have is ν, that is [n].\n• Unlike the Latin I/i, the small-letter version of Ι has no dot on top (ι).\n\nVowels\nThere is only one new vowel here. This is [u], like in foot, which is represented by the combi - nation ου. There are, though, other combinations to represent vowels you already know:\n• The sound [i] is also represented by the combinations ει or οι. Now you have five rep - resentations of [i] to worry about.\n• The sound [e] is also represented by αι.\n\nNow read the following words and check pronunciation. Note that the accent mark (if neces - sary) falls on the second letter of the combination:\n(13) κάνει, μπορεί, ώμοι, ωμοί, είμαι, αίμα, ουρά, ούλα\n\nThe Double Dot\nCombinations that represent consonants equal a single sound (or sounds). In other words, μπ is always [b/mb], etc. Combinations of vowels don’t. In other words, αι is most of the times [e], but could also be [ai]. How can you tell the difference while learning new words or while reading? These procedures involve writing, and a special mark is here to help.\n(IV) παιδάκι / παϊδάκι\nThe double dot on top of the second letter indicates that αι should be pronounced like [ai]. If the word is stressed on the first of the two vowels the accent mark by itself indicates separate pronunciation and the double dot is not necessary:\n(V) Μάιος \nWhen the combination has no accent mark or the accent mark is posited on the second letter, the letters represent a single sound (check the words of example 13).\n• The double dot in writing is not decoration. In order to realize how how important it is, go again to παιδάκι and παϊδάκι. The first word means “little child”, the second “lamb chop”.\n\nTwo Tricky Combinations: αυ/ευ\nOne of the most tricky parts of Greek spelling concerns the αυ/ευ combinations. Here the letter Υ/υ does not stand for a vowel but for a consonant (a unique case in Modern Greek writing). And, as if to make things worse, this consonant may be [v] or [f] according to the following sound:\n• [v] when the following sound is voiced (voiced sounds are vowels, and consonants such as [l] or [r]).\n• [f] when the following sound is voiceless (voiceless sounds are consonants such as [t], [k], [x]).\n(VIa) αυγό, αυλή, Παρασκευή, ευλογώ\n(VIb) αυτός, ευκολία, ευχαριστώ\nNotice that if the accent mark falls on the first letter of the combination, then the two sounds are pronounced separately and now Υ/υ represents a vowel:\n(VIII) άυπνος, άυλος",

  "audio_script": "Hello! Today, we're going to cover the rest of the Greek alphabet, from N to Ω, and explore some special vowel combinations called diphthongs. Let's begin with the letters themselves.\n\nWe have the letter N, pronounced 'n' as in 'nose'. In lowercase, it's ν. Remember, the lowercase 'v' in English is actually our 'n' sound. Be careful not to confuse it with the Latin 'v'!\n\nNext is Ξ, pronounced 'ks' like in 'ox'. The lowercase is ξ.\n\nThen we have O, pronounced like the 'o' in 'top'. The lowercase is ο. And Ω, also pronounced like the 'o' in 'top'. The lowercase is ω. Notice the capital letters look different, but the sound is the same!\n\nMoving on, we have P, pronounced as a rolled 'r', similar to Spanish or Italian 'r', not the English 'r'. The lowercase is ρ.\n\nNext is Σ, pronounced 's' as in 'see'. The lowercase has two forms: σ and ς. When the 's' sound is at the end of a word, we use -ς.\n\nWe have T, pronounced 't' as in 'stop'. The lowercase is τ. And Υ, which is another letter for the 'ee' sound, like in 'feet'. The lowercase is υ. This is one of the trickier ones, as we already have other letters for the 'ee' sound. Remember, the lowercase υ has a round bottom, not angular like the Latin 'u'.\n\nNext is Φ, pronounced 'f' as in 'fish'. The lowercase is φ.\n\nThen comes Χ, pronounced like the 'ch' in the Scottish 'loch' or the Spanish 'jamón'. The lowercase is χ.\n\nAnd finally, Ψ, pronounced 'ps' as in 'stops'. The lowercase is ψ.\n\nNow, let's talk about diphthongs and vowel combinations. These are groups of vowels that create specific sounds.\n\nWe have OU, represented by ου. This combination makes the 'oo' sound, like in 'foot'. For example, ουρά (oura), meaning 'tail', and ούλα (oula), meaning 'gums'.\n\nThen there's AI, represented by αι. This combination usually makes the 'e' sound, like in 'pen'. For example, αίμα (aima), meaning 'blood'. However, sometimes, especially when you see two dots, called a diaeresis, above the second vowel like in παιδάκι (paidaki), it's pronounced as two separate vowel sounds: 'a-ee'. This changes the meaning, so παιδάκι means 'little child', while παϊδάκι means 'lamb chop'. We also see this in Μάιος (Maios), meaning 'May'.\n\nAnother important combination is EI, represented by ει. This also makes the 'ee' sound, like in 'feet'. For example, είμαι (eimai), meaning 'I am'.\n\nWe also have OI, represented by οι, which also makes the 'ee' sound, like in 'feet'. For example, μπορεί (mporei), meaning 'can'.\n\nAnd finally, let's look at AU and EU, represented by αυ and ευ. These are special because the 'υ' here acts as a consonant, either 'v' or 'f', depending on the following sound. If the next sound is voiced, like a vowel or 'l' or 'r', then υ sounds like 'v'. For example, αυγό (avgó) means 'egg', and ευλογώ (evlogó) means 'to bless'. If the next sound is voiceless, like 't', 'k', or 'ch', then υ sounds like 'f'. For example, αυτός (aftós) means 'this', and ευχαριστώ (efcharistó) means 'thank you'.\n\nIf the accent mark falls on the 'υ' in 'αυ' or 'ευ', it means the 'υ' is pronounced separately as a vowel. For example, αύριο (ávrio) means 'tomorrow', and εύκολος (éfkolos) means 'easy'. But if the accent is on the first vowel, like in άυπνος (áypnos), it means the two vowels are separate sounds, and 'υ' is a vowel sound here.\n\nRemember to practice these letters and combinations. Pay close attention to the examples and the sound they make. The more you practice, the easier it will become! Let's move on."
