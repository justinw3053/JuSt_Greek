  "reading_english": "LETTERS N-Ω (Page 2)\n\n1. XI (Ξ): Sounds like 'ks' in 'box'.\n2. SIGMA (Σ, σ, ς): \n   - 'σ' inside a word.\n   - 'ς' ONLY at the end of a word.\n3. UPSILON (Υ): Usually 'i' (like machine), but changes in combos (av/ev).\n4. CHI (X): A soft throat clearing sound (like 'Hel-lo' but harder, or Scottish 'Loch').\n5. PSI (Ψ): Sounds like 'ps' in 'lips'.\n6. OMEGA (Ω): Sounds exactly the same as Omicron (O). 'o' in 'pot'.",
  "audio_script": "Part 2 of the Alphabet! We finish the letters from Nu to Omega. \n\nPay attention to 'Xi' (Ks) and 'Psi' (Ps) - these are double sounds written as one letter. \n\nAlso 'Sigma' has a special rule: Use the normal 'σ' everywhere, except at the very end of a word where you use the 'tail' sigma 'ς'. \n\nFinally, 'Chi' (X). It is not 'K'. It is a soft friction sound in the throat. 'Xeri' (Hand), not 'Keri'.",
