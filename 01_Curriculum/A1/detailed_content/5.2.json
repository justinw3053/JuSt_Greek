  "audio_script": "Hello! Today we are looking at Neuter Plurals. As we saw in our grammar notes, Neuter nouns are quite friendly because they often undergo the fewest changes. Let's look at the two main patterns for nouns ending in 'o' and 'i' found in Chapter 3. ... First, the article always changes from 'to' to 'ta'. ... For nouns ending in 'o', like 'to vivlío', we simply replace the 'o' with an 'a' to get 'ta vivlía'. This works for 'to karóto' too, which becomes 'ta karóta'. ... Now, for nouns ending in 'i', it's slightly different. The 'i' stays, but we add an 'a' at the end. For example, 'to paidí' becomes 'ta paidiá'. Notice how the stress stays on the final 'a'. ... Similarly, 'to spíti' becomes 'ta spítia'. One interesting thing from our textbook is that in words like 'paidiá', the 'i' sound transforms into a consonant-like 'y' sound. ... Finally, remember our note on loanwords like 'to garáz'. These stay exactly the same in the plural, only the article changes: 'ta garáz'. ... Keep practicing these forms, as they are essential for describing the things around you!"
