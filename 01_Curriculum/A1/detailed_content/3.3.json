  "audio_script": "Hello and welcome back! Today, we're going to learn how to express negation in Modern Greek, specifically how to say 'I do not have'. This is a very common and useful phrase.\n\nIn Modern Greek, the primary way to make a statement negative is by using the word 'δεν' (den). Think of 'δεν' as the equivalent of 'not' in English when we're negating a verb. It comes directly before the verb.\n\nLet's start with the verb 'to have', which is 'έχω' (echo). We'll conjugate it with 'δεν' to make it negative. Listen carefully:\n\n'Δεν έχω' (den echo)... This means 'I do not have'.\n'Δεν έχεις' (den echis)... This means 'You do not have'.\n'Δεν έχει' (den ehi)... This means 'He, she, or it does not have'.\n'Δεν έχουμε' (den echoume)... This means 'We do not have'.\n'Δεν έχετε' (den echete)... This means 'You (plural) do not have'.\nAnd finally, 'Δεν έχουν' (den echoun)... This means 'They do not have'.\n\nNotice how 'δεν' is always placed before the conjugated form of the verb 'έχω'.\n\nNow, let's put this into practice with some full sentences. We'll combine the negative verb with a noun phrase. Remember, in Greek, we often don't need a direct equivalent for 'a' or 'an' when it's implied, but for clarity, I'll provide the English translations.\n\nListen and repeat:\n'Εγώ δεν έχω βιβλίο.' (Ego den echo vivlio). This translates to 'I do not have a book.'\n\n'Εσύ δεν έχεις αυτοκίνητο.' (Esi den echis aftokinito). This means 'You do not have a car.'\n\n'Αυτός/Αυτή/Αυτό δεν έχει κλειδί.' (Aftos/Afti/Afto den ehi klithi). This translates to 'He, she, or it does not have a key.'\n\n'Εμείς δεν έχουμε χρόνο.' (Emis den echoume chronο). 'We do not have time.'\n\n'Εσείς δεν έχετε διάθεση.' (Esis den echete diathesi). 'You (plural) do not have the mood.'\n\nAnd 'Αυτοί/Αυτές/Αυτά δεν έχουν ιδέα.' (Afti/Aftes/Afta den echoun idea). 'They do not have an idea.'\n\nGreat job! Practicing these negative sentences will help you become more comfortable with expressing what you *don't* possess. Keep practicing these forms, and you'll master them in no time!"
