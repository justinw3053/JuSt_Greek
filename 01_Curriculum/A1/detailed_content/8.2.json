  "audio_script": "Hello! Let's continue our journey into Modern Greek grammar. Today, we're focusing on some very common verbs and how they change, specifically when we talk about past actions in the aorist tense. This is covered in Chapter 8 of our textbook.\n\nIn Modern Greek, verbs often change slightly to indicate past actions. We're going to look at three essential verbs: 'kano' (to do/make), 'meno' (to stay/live), and 'thelo' (to want). These are fundamental for everyday communication.\n\nLet's start with 'kano'. The imperfective stem, which we use for present actions, is 'kan-'. When we put it into the aorist tense, it becomes 'ekana'. So, 'I did' or 'I made' is 'ekana'.\n\nNext, we have 'meno'. Its imperfective stem is 'men-'. In the aorist, it transforms into 'emina'. This means 'I stayed' or 'I lived'.\n\nAnd finally, 'thelo'. The imperfective stem here is 'thel-'. For the aorist, it changes to 'ithela', meaning 'I wanted'.\n\nNow, let's look at some other verbs that follow a similar pattern, which the textbook calls 'regular verbs' in section 8.1.3. These are also very common!\n\nWe have 'grapho', which means 'to write'. In the aorist, it becomes 'egrapsa' - 'I wrote'.\n\nThen there's 'pino', meaning 'to drink'. The aorist form is 'ipia' - 'I drank'.\n\n'Vlevo' means 'to see'. Its aorist form is 'ida' - 'I saw'.\n\n'Paizo', meaning 'to play', becomes 'epaipsa' in the aorist - 'I played'.\n\nAnd finally, 'akouo', which means 'to hear' or 'to listen'. In the aorist, it's 'akousa' - 'I heard' or 'I listened'.\n\nRemember, mastering these verb forms is crucial. Keep practicing them! We'll explore more verb tenses and forms in upcoming lessons. Thank you!"
