  "audio_script": "Hello! Today we are looking at how to make feminine nouns plural. In Modern Greek, this is actually quite simple because two different singular endings merge into one plural ending. ... Take a look at your textbook on page 44. You will see that feminine nouns ending in alpha, like 'η ώρα'—meaning the hour—and nouns ending in ita, like 'η ζώνη'—the belt—both follow the same rule in the plural. ... First, the article 'η' changes to 'οι'. Then, the ending 'α' or 'η' is replaced by 'ες'. ... Let's practice with some examples from our vocabulary lists. ... 'Η ώρα' becomes 'οι ώρες'. ... 'Η ζώνη' becomes 'οι ζώνες'. ... This even applies to loanwords that have entered the Greek system, like 'η πίτσα', which becomes 'οι πίτσες'. ... We also see this in our food vocabulary on page 33: 'η ντομάτα' becomes 'οι ντομάτες' and 'η μπανάνα' becomes 'οι μπανάνες'. ... Remember, as the textbook notes, the plural forms of these nouns are identical in both the Nominative and Accusative cases, though the article will change to 'τις' when it's an object. For now, focus on that 'ες' ending. It is the signature of the feminine plural!"
