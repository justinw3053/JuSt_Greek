  "reading_english": "GRAMMAR: FEMININE PLURALS [(See Page 44)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=44)\n\n1. THE 'GOLDEN RULE': Feminine nouns are easy in plural. \n   - Almost ALL of them end in -es.\n\n2. ARTICLE CHANGES:\n   - Nominative: 'H' becomes 'Oi'. (H ora -> Oi ores).\n   - Accusative: 'Tin' becomes 'Tis'. (Tin ora -> Tis ores).\n\n3. PRONUNCIATION:\n   - 'Oi' (Nom) and 'H' (Sing) sound identical (ee).\n   - 'Tis' (Acc) is distinct. You can hear the 's'.",
  "audio_script": "Feminine Plurals are the easiest in Greek. \n\nWhether the word ends in Alpha (H gynaika) or Eta (H timi), the plural ending is always '-es'.\n- Oi gynaikes.\n- Oi times.\n\nThe Article changes too:\n- 'H' becomes 'Oi' (Subject).\n- 'Tin' becomes 'Tis' (Object).\n\nPay attention to the Accusative 'Tis'. \n'Tis' is clearly feminine plural. \nIf you say 'Tous' (Masc), people expect men. \nIf you say 'Tis' (Fem), people expect women or feminine things. \n'Vlepo TIS files mou' (I see my girlfriends).",
