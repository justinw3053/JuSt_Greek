  "audio_script": "Hello there! Today we're going to learn how to tell time in Modern Greek. It's a very useful skill!\n\nFirst, to ask 'What time is it?', you say: \"Τι ώρα είναι;\" ... \"Τι ώρα είναι;\"\n\nNow, to say the time, we start with 'It is...' which is \"Είναι...\".\n\nLet's learn the numbers from one to twelve:\n\nOne is 'μία'. ... 'μία'.\nTwo is 'δύο'. ... 'δύο'.\nThree is 'τρεις'. ... 'τρεις'.\nFour is 'τέσσερις'. ... 'τέσσερις'.\nFive is 'πέντε'. ... 'πέντε'.\nSix is 'έξι'. ... 'έξι'.\nSeven is 'επτά'. ... 'επτά'.\nEight is 'οκτώ'. ... 'οκτώ'.\nNine is 'εννέα'. ... 'εννέα'.\nTen is 'δέκα'. ... 'δέκα'.\nEleven is 'έντεκα'. ... 'έντεκα'.\nAnd twelve is 'δώδεκα'. ... 'δώδεκα'.\n\nSo, if it's one o'clock, you'd say: \"Είναι μία.\"\nIf it's six o'clock: \"Είναι έξι.\"\nAnd if it's twelve o'clock: \"Είναι δώδεκα.\"\n\nNow, let's talk about minutes. For the first fifteen minutes past the hour, we say 'and a quarter'. In Greek, this is \"και τέταρτο\". ... \"και τέταρτο\".\nSo, one fifteen is \"Είναι μία και τέταρτο.\"\nAnd seven fifteen would be \"Είναι επτά και τέταρτο.\"\n\nWhen it's exactly half past the hour, we use the word 'half', which is \"μισή\". So, we say \"και μισή\". ... \"και μισή\".\nFor example, two thirty is \"Είναι δύο και μισή.\"\nAnd ten thirty is \"Είναι δέκα και μισή.\"\n\nWhat about after the half hour? We use the word 'minus', or 'before', which is \"παρά\". ... \"παρά\".\n\nSo, if it's twenty-five to the next hour, it's like saying 'five minus ten'. In Greek, this is \"παρά δέκα πέντε\". ... \"παρά δέκα πέντε\".\n\nIf it's quarter to the hour, we say \"παρά τέταρτο\". ... \"παρά τέταρτο\".\nSo, three forty-five would be \"Είναι τέσσερις παρά τέταρτο.\"\nAnd nine forty-five would be \"Είναι δέκα παρά τέταρτο.\"\n\nFor other minutes past the hour, we simply say 'and' followed by the number of minutes.\nFor example, if it's four twenty, you say \"Είναι τέσσερις και είκοσι.\"\nIf it's eight ten, you say \"Είναι οκτώ και δέκα.\"\n\nLet's practice a few more:\n\nWhat time is it? \"Τι ώρα είναι;\"\nIt is five o'clock: \"Είναι πέντε.\"\nIt is six thirty: \"Είναι έξι και μισή.\"\nIt is seven fifteen: \"Είναι επτά και τέταρτο.\"\nIt is eight forty-five: \"Είναι εννέα παρά τέταρτο.\"\nIt is eleven twenty: \"Είναι έντεκα και είκοσι.\"\n\nGreat job! Keep practicing these phrases, and you'll be telling time in no time!"
