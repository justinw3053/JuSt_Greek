  "audio_script": "Καλώς ορίσατε! Welcome, students, to Chapter 4... where we delve deeper into the fascinating world of Modern Greek nouns.\n\nIn Chapter 2, we discussed the basic grammar of nouns: gender, number, and case. And in Chapter 3, we began to explore the Nominative and Accusative cases, and how nouns change form according to their syntactic role and their number.\n\nToday... our focus is specifically on a very common group of **masculine nouns**... and how they form their **plural** in both the Nominative and Accusative cases. We're looking at masculine nouns that end in **-ος** in their singular Nominative form.\n\nLet's take our first example, straight from the textbook: **ο δρόμος**... 'the street'.\nNow, how do we make 'streets' in Greek? Observe the change...\n\nFor the **Nominative Plural**... the article **ο** changes to **οι**... and the noun ending **-ος** changes to **-οι**.\nSo, **ο δρόμος**... becomes **οι δρόμοι**... 'the streets'.\n\nDo you see that? The article changes, and the final syllable of the noun changes from -ος to -οι. This is a very regular pattern for this group of masculine nouns.\n\nNow, let's also look at the **Accusative Plural**.\nRemember from Chapter 3 that the singular accusative for **ο δρόμος** is **τον δρόμο**... where the final -ς of the noun is dropped, and the article changes from ο to τον.\n\nFor the **Accusative Plural**... the article **τους** is used... and the noun ending becomes **-ους**.\nSo, **τον δρόμο**... becomes **τους δρόμους**... 'the streets' in the accusative.\nAgain, both the article and the noun ending transform. Notice the final -ς appears again in the noun in the plural accusative, but it is combined with the -ου stem to make -ους.\n\nLet's practice with a few more examples. Pay close attention to the article and the noun ending in both the singular and the plural, across both cases.\n\nFirst, the word for 'person' or 'human': **ο άνθρωπος**.\nIn the Nominative Plural, it becomes: **οι άνθρωποι**.\nIn the Accusative Singular: **τον άνθρωπο**.\nIn the Accusative Plural: **τους ανθρώπους**.\n\nNext, 'friend': **ο φίλος**.\nNominative Plural: **οι φίλοι**.\nAccusative Singular: **τον φίλο**.\nAccusative Plural: **τους φίλους**.\n\nThen, 'number': **ο αριθμός**.\nNominative Plural: **οι αριθμοί**.\nAccusative Singular: **τον αριθμό**.\nAccusative Plural: **τους αριθμούς**.\n\nAnd finally, 'way' or 'manner': **ο τρόπος**.\nNominative Plural: **οι τρόποι**.\nAccusative Singular: **τον τρόπο**.\nAccusative Plural: **τους τρόπους**.\n\nAs you can see, this pattern is consistent for masculine nouns ending in -ος. It's a fundamental pattern to master for building your Greek vocabulary and sentences.\n\nRemember that Modern Greek, being an inflectional language, uses these endings to convey grammatical information. Mastering these transformations is crucial for clarity and correct communication.\n\nKeep in mind, as the textbook highlights, that while this is a very common pattern, not *all* masculine nouns follow *this exact* ending change for their plural, as we saw with **ο άντρας** or **ο χάρτης** in Chapter 3. But for the vast majority of masculine nouns ending in **-ος**... this rule holds true.\n\nPractice these examples diligently. Repeat them aloud. Familiarize yourself with these shifts, as they are the building blocks of fluid Greek speech. No procrastination! Let us proceed with these forms engraved in your memory."
