## Lesson 1.1: The Alphabet (A - M). Sounds & Writing.

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: The Alphabet (A - M). Sounds & Writing.

INTRODUCTION:
Καλημέρα! Welcome to your first Greek lesson. I am your tutor, and I expect your full attention and effort. Today, we begin with the very foundation: The Greek Alphabet. We will focus on the first twelve letters, from Alpha to Mu. Pay close attention to the sounds and how they are written.

Let's start. First, we have **Α/α**... The letter Alpha, A/α, represents a short 'a' sound, just like in the English word 'hat'. In Modern Greek, we do not have long vowels, so keep it short and crisp. This sound, [a], will be a foundation as we introduce other consonants.

Next, **Β/β**... Now, this is crucial. Β/β is *not* the 'b' sound you might expect from English. It is a 'v' sound, as in 'vase'. Remember this, it is a common point of confusion for beginners.

Moving on, **Γ/γ**... This sound has no direct equivalent in English. It is a softer sound, closer to the 'r' in the French word 'rendez-vous'. Try to replicate that gentle, almost guttural sound. When writing the small letter, Γ/γ, notice that the typing font has no inner space at the bottom.

Then, **Δ/δ**... This letter represents the 'th' sound in 'than'. It is a voiced sound, unlike its counterpart Θ/θ which we will see shortly. Practice placing your tongue for this sound.

Now, **Ε/ε**... E/ε stands for the 'e' sound, like in 'pen'. Simple and straightforward.

Next is **Ζ/ζ**... This one should be easy. The capital letter looks like the English 'Z', and it represents the 'z' sound, as in 'zoo'. When writing the small letter, first draw a horizontal line, then continue with a final 's' shape.

Moving on to **Η/η**... The letter H/η represents a short 'i' sound, like in 'tip'. This is the first of several letters that will represent the *same* 'i' sound. Keep this in mind for spelling later.

Then, **Θ/θ**... This letter stands for the 'th' sound, like in 'thin'. Unlike Δ/δ, this is a voiceless sound. Compare them: [δ] in 'than' versus [θ] in 'thin'.

Next, **Ι/ι**... And here is the second representation for that 'i' sound, again, like in 'tip'. So, Η/η and Ι/ι represent *exactly* the same sound now. Why two different letters? Because in Ancient Greek, they had distinct sounds. Modern Greek preserves the writing, even though the phonetic difference is gone. Also, when writing the small letter, Ι/ι, remember it has *no dot* on top, unlike the Latin 'i'.

Now, **Κ/κ**... This letter stands for an unaspirated 'k' sound, close to the 'k' in 'book'. It's not like the 'k' in 'kite' which has a puff of air.

Next, **Λ/λ**... Here we have an 'l' sound. It is closer to the 'light l' in 'like', not the 'dark l' you find at the end of words like 'little' in English.

And finally for today, **Μ/μ**... It is easy to relate the capital M to an 'm' sound, like in 'make'. To write the small letter, first draw a vertical line, then something similar to the Latin 'u'.

To summarize a few common pitfalls for these letters: Remember that **Β/β** is [v], not [b]. **Η/η** is [i], not an English 'h'. And **Ι/ι** in small form has no dot. Your memory is key here. Practice these sounds diligently. Repeat them until they become second nature. We will build upon this foundation next time. Any questions? If not, practice!

GRAMMAR NOTES:
**Reference**: [(See Page 2)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=2)

The letter A/α represents a short [a], like in hat.
This letter is not a [b], as you might expect. It’s a [v], like in vase.
The sound represented by Γ/γ has no equivalent in English. It is closer to the initial sound of the French word rendez-vous.
This letter represents [δ] like in than.
E/ε stands for [e], like in pen.
It is really easy to relate the capital letter to [z], like in zoo.
The letter Η/η represents a short [i], like in tip.
This letter stands for [θ], like in thin.
The letter again represents [i] like in tip (see H/η). So far two different letters, Η/η and Ι/ι, represent exactly the same sound.
This letter stands for an unaspirated [k] sound which is close to book.
Here we have an [l] that is closer to the light [l] of like and not the dark [l] of little.
It is easy to relate the capital M to an [m] sound like in make.

## Lesson 1.2: The Alphabet: Part 2 (N - Ω)

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: The Alphabet: Part 2 (N - Ω)

INTRODUCTION:
Part 2 of the Alphabet! We finish the letters from Nu to Omega. 

Pay attention to 'Xi' (Ks) and 'Psi' (Ps) - these are double sounds written as one letter. 

Also 'Sigma' has a special rule: Use the normal 'σ' everywhere, except at the very end of a word where you use the 'tail' sigma 'ς'. 

Finally, 'Chi' (X). It is not 'K'. It is a soft friction sound in the throat. 'Xeri' (Hand), not 'Keri'.

GRAMMAR NOTES:
LETTERS N-Ω [(See Page 2)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=2)

1. XI (Ξ): Sounds like 'ks' in 'box'.
2. SIGMA (Σ, σ, ς): 
   - 'σ' inside a word.
   - 'ς' ONLY at the end of a word.
3. UPSILON (Υ): Usually 'i' (like machine), but changes in combos (av/ev).
4. CHI (X): A soft throat clearing sound (like 'Hel-lo' but harder, or Scottish 'Loch').
5. PSI (Ψ): Sounds like 'ps' in 'lips'.
6. OMEGA (Ω): Sounds exactly the same as Omicron (O). 'o' in 'pot'.

## Lesson 1.3: Reading Practice: Stress & Diphthongs

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Reading Practice: Stress & Diphthongs

INTRODUCTION:
Exercise Time! Open your Grammar Notes to Page 5. 

Let's start with Drill 1: Short Words. 
- 'Με' (me - with), 'Μα' (ma - but), 'Μη' (mi - don't).
- 'Σε' (se - to you), 'Ας' (as - let).

Now proper reading in Drill 4. 
- Αθήνα: The stress is on the 'i'. Not A-the-na, but A-thi-na.
- Πέτρος: Stress the first syllable. PE-tros.

Now the most important concept: STRESS (Page 6).
Listen carefully: 'PO-te' means 'When'. 'Po-TE' means 'Never'.
If you say 'When I go to Greece' but use 'Never', people will be confused! 
Stress is not decoration. It is meaning.

GRAMMAR NOTES:
**Reference**: [(See Page 2)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=2)

STRESS RULES (From Page 6)

1. Dynamic Stress: Stress is not fixed. It can be on any of the last 3 syllables.
2. The Accent Mark: In lowercase, the mark (΄) tells you EXACTLY where to put the stress. It is obligatory.
3. Meaning Change: Changing stress changes meaning! 
   - pote (when) vs poTE (never).
   - oMOS (raw) vs Omos (shoulder).

TRANSLITERATION NOTES

- Αθήνα: Note the 'η' (i) sound.
- Πέτρος: Note the rolled 'ρ'.
- Αντώνης: 'ντ' at the start or middle is [d] or [nd].
- Ελλάδα: Double 'λλ' is just a single [l] sound.
- Κρήτη: Both 'η' are [i].

## Lesson 1.4: Special Sounds: Digraphs & Vowels

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Special Sounds: Digraphs & Vowels

INTRODUCTION:
This is a crucial lesson. Digraphs! 

In English, 'Ph' makes an 'F' sound. In Greek, we do this a lot.

Key Pairs:
- Mu + Pi (Μπ) sounds like 'B'. 'Mpala' is pronounced 'Bala'.
- Nu + Tau (Ντ) sounds like 'D'. 'Ntomata' is pronounced 'Domata'.

Also, Vowels:
- 'Ou' (Omicron Upsilon) is the ONLY way to write the sound 'oo'.
- 'Ai' (Alpha Iota) sounds like 'E' (as in 'Met'). 'Nai' (Yes) rhymes with 'Day' shortened.

Mastering these 4-5 combinations unlocks 90% of Greek reading.

GRAMMAR NOTES:
RULES OF SOUND [(See Page 6)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=6)

1. THE HARD SOUNDS: Greek has no single letter for B, D, G (hard). 
   - We combine letters to make them.
   - M + Pi = B (Mpala -> Bala)
   - N + Tau = D (Ntomata -> Domata)
   - Gamma + Kappa = G (Gkol -> Gol)

2. THE 'I' SOUND: Greek is famous for having many ways to write 'i'.
   - Iota (ι)
   - Eta (η)
   - Upsilon (υ)
   - Epsilon-Iota (ει)
   - Omicron-Iota (οι)
   All sound exactly the same: 'ee'.

3. THE 'U' SOUND: To make the sound 'oo' (moon), you MUST write 'ΟΥ'.

## Lesson 10.1: Subject vs Object: The Concept

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Subject vs Object: The Concept

INTRODUCTION:
This is the most important syntax rule in Greek. 

Who is doing the action? (Subject - Nominative).
Who is receiving the action? (Object - Accusative).

For Masculine nouns, you MUST hear the difference.
Subject: O Petros (Ends in S).
Object: Ton Petro (No S).

'O Petros vlepei ton Niko'. (Peter sees Nick).
'O Nikos vlepei ton Petro'. (Nick sees Peter).

Listen for the 'S'. If you hear the 'S', he is the doer.

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: CASE ROLES [(See Page 139)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=139)

1. WHO DOES WHAT?
   - In English, we say 'Dog bites Man'. If we swap it 'Man bites Dog', the meaning changes.
   - In Greek, cases control meaning. 'Tonas skylos dagkonei ton anthropo'.

2. MASCULINE IS KING OF CHANGE:
   - Masculine nouns change the most. 
   - Nominative: -OS. (O Petros)
   - Accusative: -O. (Ton Petro)
   - Drop the 'S'!

## Lesson 10.2: Drill: Masculine Changes (-os -> -o)

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Drill: Masculine Changes (-os -> -o)

INTRODUCTION:
Let's drill the Masculine Accusative. 

Whatever the masculine noun, usually you just drop the 's'.

O kafes -> Ton kafe.
O pateras -> Ton patera.
O ouranos -> Ton ourano.

Exceptions exist but they are rare for beginners. 

Try it: 'I want the coffee'. 
'Thelo ton kafe'. 
Not 'Thelo o kafes'. That would mean 'The coffee wants...' (which is weird).

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: MASCULINE ACCUSATIVE [(See Page 139)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=139)

1. THE ARTICLE:
   - Only 'Ton'. Never 'O'.

2. THE NOUN:
   - Drop the Sigma (-s).
   - O Kafes -> Ton Kafe.
   - O Nomos -> Ton Nomo.

3. PROPER NAMES:
   - O Kostas -> Ton Kosta.
   - O Andreas -> Ton Andrea.

## Lesson 10.3: Drill: Feminine & Neuter (H -> Tin, To -> To)

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Drill: Feminine & Neuter (H -> Tin, To -> To)

INTRODUCTION:
Feminine and Neuter are easier.

For Feminine, focus on the article 'Tin'. The noun usually doesn't change.
'H ora' -> 'Tin ora'.
'H agapi' -> 'Tin agapi'.

For Neuter, relax. Nothing changes.
'To nero'. Subject or Object, it is 'To nero'.

So only Masculine nouns require you to 'Drop the S'.

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: FEM/NEUT ACCUSATIVE [(See Page 139)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=139)

1. FEMININE:
   - Article: H -> Tin.
   - Noun: Usually unchanged (exceptions exist but for -a/-i nouns like Poli/Maria, it's just the article).

2. NEUTER:
   - The easiest case.
   - Subject = Object.
   - 'To vivlio einai edo'. 'Thelo to vivlio'. Identical.

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Pronouns: Weak Forms (Me, Se, Ton)

INTRODUCTION:
Pronouns. Short words, huge importance. 

In English we say 'I love YOU'. 
In Greek we say 'S'agapao' (You I-love). 
The pronoun comes BEFORE the verb.

'Me' -> Me.
'Se' -> You.
'Ton' -> Him.
'Tin' -> Her.
'To' -> It.

'Ton vlepo'. I see him.
'Tin vlepo'. I see her.

If you want to emphasize 'I love YOU (and not her)', use the Strong form 'Esena'. 
'Esena agapao'. 
But normally: 'S'agapao'.

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: PERSONAL PRONOUNS [(See Page 83)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=83)

1. WEAK vs STRONG:
   - Strong: Emena (Me). Used for emphasis.
   - Weak: Me (Me). Used 90% of the time.

2. WORD ORDER:
   - Unlike English (I see YOU - after),
   - Greek puts it BEFORE.
   - 'Se vlepo' (You I-see).
   - 'Ton xero' (Him I-know).

## Lesson 12.1: Politeness & Formal Speech

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Politeness & Formal Speech

INTRODUCTION:
Being polite in Greece. 

Use the Plural 'Eseis' to show respect.

'Ti kanete?' instead of 'Ti kaneis?'.
'Thelete?' instead of 'Theleis?'.

If you speak to a 'Kyrios' (Sir) or 'Kyria' (Madam), use the Plural. 
It sounds elegant and respectful.

'Euxaristo' is the standard thank you. 
'Parakalo' is the magic word. It means Please, You're Welcome, and 'I beg your pardon?'.

GRAMMAR NOTES:
CULTURE: POLITENESS [(See Page 93)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=93)

1. THE 'ESEIS' RULE:
   - Use Plural 'Eseis' for elders, professors, or strangers.
   - 'Thelete' (Do you want? - Formal) vs 'Theleis' (Informal).

2. SHIFTING:
   - Greeks often say 'Milame ston eniko?' (Shall we speak in singular?).
   - This invites you to drop the formality.

## Lesson 2.1: Nouns & Verbs: The Basics (To Be)

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Nouns & Verbs: The Basics (To Be)

INTRODUCTION:
Welcome to Chapter 2! On Page 21, the book introduces the concept of **Inflection**. Unlike English, where 'street' is always 'street', in Greek, 'dromos' becomes 'dromoi' or 'dromou'. The ending carries the meaning.

Today's verb is **Eimai** (To Be). It is irregular but essential.
- 'Eimai' (I am).
- 'Eisai' (You are).
- 'Einai' (It is).

Notice the example: 'Eisai kala?' (Are you well?). We don't say 'Esu eisai kala?'. We drop the 'Esu' (You) because 'Eisai' specifically means YOU are. This is the 'Optional Subject' rule.

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR NOTES [(See Page 21)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=21)

1. INFLECTION: Modern Greek words change their endings to show meaning.
   - Base (Stem): 'drom-' (street)
   - Ending: '-os' (singular) / '-oi' (plural)

2. THE VERB 'TO BE' (Page 59 - Irregular)
   - eimai: I am
   - eisai: You are
   - einai: He/She/It is
   - eimaste: We are
   - eiste: You are (plural/polite)
   - einai: They are

3. THE OPTIONAL SUBJECT [(See Page 27)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=27)
   - You don't need to say 'Ego eimai' (I am). Just 'Eimai' is enough.
   - The verb ending '-mai' already tells us it is 'I'.

## Lesson 2.2: Genders: Masculine, Feminine, Neuter

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Genders: Masculine, Feminine, Neuter

INTRODUCTION:
Gender! Page 22. This is the most important concept in nouns. 

In English, a chair is 'it'. In Greek, a chair is 'She' (H Karekla).
In English, a book is 'it'. In Greek, a book is 'It' (To Vivlio).
In English, a coffee is 'it'. In Greek, a coffee is 'He' (O Kafes).

How do you know? Look at the Article (The).
- Masculine: O
- Feminine: H (Eta)
- Neuter: To

Loanwords like 'Computer' or 'Festival' don't fit the Greek patterns, so they are almost always NEUTER. 'To Computer'. But 'Pizza' ends in 'a', so it becomes Feminine: 'H Pitsa'.

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GENDER RULES [(See Page 22)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=22)

1. THE BIG THREE: Every noun MUST be Masculine, Feminine, or Neuter.
2. THE ARTICLE IS KING: Don't guess gender. Look at the word 'the'.
   - 'O' = Masculine
   - 'H' (ee) = Feminine
   - 'To' = Neuter
3. FALSE FRIENDS: 
   - Chairs (karekla) are Feminine.
   - Girls (koritsi) are Neuter (grammatically 'small thing').
   - Coffee (kafes) is Masculine.

4. LOANWORD RULE [(See Page 24)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=24): Foreign words usually become NEUTER (to computer, to festival). Unless they sound Greek (Pizza -> Pitsa -> H Pitsa).

## Lesson 2.3: Basic Intros: 'I am O Justin'

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

TOPIC: Basic Intros: 'I am O Justin'

INTRODUCTION:
Introductions! The biggest surprise for English speakers is the Article on Names. 

If your name is Peter, you are 'O Petros'. 
If your name is Maria, you are 'H Maria'. 

So when you introduce yourself, say 'Eimai O [Name]'. 

Also, to point at things, we used the verb 'Einai' (It is). 
'Einai to nero' (It is the water / This is the water). 
Remember to match the article: O dromos, H ora, To vivlio.

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: PROPER NOUNS [(See Page 15)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=15)

In Greek, names take articles!
- You don't say 'I am Justin'.
- You say 'I am THE Justin' (Eimai O Justin).
- 'I am THE Maria' (Eimai H Maria).

GRAMMAR: 'THIS IS'
- Greek doesn't strictly separate 'It is' vs 'This is' yet.
- 'Einai to vivlio' = It is the book / This is the book.
- Use the gender of the object (O, H, To).

INTRODUCTION:
Meet your new best friend: The verb 'Kano'. 

It follows the standard Group A conjugation (-o, -eis, -ei). 

We use it for everything.
- 'Ti kaneis?' = How are you?
- 'Kano kafes' = I am making coffee.
- 'Kano mathima' = I am doing a lesson.

Remember: Greek Present Tense is continuous. 'Kano' means 'I do' AND 'I am doing'. You don't need to add 'Eimai' (I am) before it. Just 'Kano'.

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: THE VERB 'ΚΑΝΩ' [(See Page 33)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=33)

1. THE 'JOKER' VERB: 'Kano' is the most useful verb in Greek. It means 'To Do' or 'To Make'.

2. USED FOR QUESTIONS: 'Ti kaneis?' literally means 'What are you doing?', but it is the standard greeting for 'How are you?'.

3. CONTINUOUS MEANING: In Greek, 'Kano' means both 'I do' and 'I am doing'. There is no separate 'am doing' form in the present.

INTRODUCTION:
Let's go to a Greek Cafe! This is your first real-world mission. 

The waiter will approach and say 'Parakalo?'. Don't panic. He is just asking 'What can I do for you?'.

To order, keep it simple. 
'Enan kafe, parakalo'. (A coffee, please). 

But in Greece, coffee is an art. You must specify the sweetness. 
- Sketos (Black/Plain).
- Metrios (Medium).
- Glykos (Sweet).

So the full order: 'Enan frappe, metrio, me gala' (A frappe, medium, with milk).

GRAMMAR NOTES:

2. ACCUSATIVE CASE (Ordering):
   - When you order, you want the object.
   - Enas kafes (Subject) -> Enan kafe (Object).
   - 'Thelo enan kafe' (I want a coffee).

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: The Verb 'To Have' (Έχω)

INTRODUCTION:
Chapter 3! The Verb 'Exo' (To Have). 

This is the second most important verb after 'Eimai'. 
Memorize the endings: -o, -eis, -ei, -oume, -ete, -oun. 

Crucial Rule: The object of 'Exo' is ALWAYS in the Accusative Case. 
You don't 'have' a subject. You 'have' an object. 

Also, a fun tip: In English you 'are' hungry. In Greek, you 'have' hunger (Exo peina). 
Don't say 'Eimai peina' (I am hunger) - that means you are the abstract concept of starvation!

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: THE VERB 'TO HAVE' [(See Page 35)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=35)

1. OBLIGATORY ACCUSATIVE: When you 'have' something, that something is the OBJECT.
   - You cannot say 'Exo O Petros' (I have The Peter - Nominative).
   - You must say 'Exo TON Petro' (I have The Peter - Accusative).

2. PHYSICAL STATES: Greek uses 'Have' for hunger/thirst/cold.
   - 'Exo peina' ( I have hunger = I am hungry).
   - 'Exo dipsa' (I have thirst = I am thirsty).

## Lesson 3.2: Basic Nouns (House, Car, Book, Money).

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Basic Nouns (House, Car, Book, Money).

INTRODUCTION:
Καλημέρα, students. Today we continue our journey into the world of Modern Greek nouns, focusing on their forms and usage in context. Specifically, we will examine some basic nouns: 'book', 'car', 'house', and 'money' as discussed in Chapter 3.

As you learned in Unit 3.1, Modern Greek nouns, unlike English nouns, change their form based on their role in the sentence... and their number. This variation is called 'case'. For now, we focus on the Nominative and Accusative cases, in both singular and plural.

Let's start with **το βιβλίο**... 'the book'. This is a neuter noun. Remember from Table 3.1, neuter nouns are the easiest! They undergo no change at all for the singular accusative. And for the plural, as shown in Table 3.4, they take new endings.

Listen carefully to these examples:
1. Το βιβλίο είναι παλιό. 'The book is old.' Here, 'το βιβλίο' is the subject, so it's in the Nominative singular.
2. Θέλω το βιβλίο. 'I want the book.' Now, 'το βιβλίο' is the object, it is in the Accusative singular. Notice, the form remains identical to the Nominative.
3. Διαβάζω από το βιβλίο. 'I am reading from the book.' Here, 'το βιβλίο' is part of a prepositional phrase, so it's in the Accusative singular. Still the same form.

Now, for the plural:
4. Τα βιβλία είναι καινούργια. 'The books are new.' 'Τα βιβλία' is Nominative plural, the subject.
5. Αγοράζω τα βιβλία. 'I buy the books.' This is Accusative plural, the object. Again, same form as Nominative plural.
6. Μιλάω για τα βιβλία. 'I talk about the books.' Accusative plural, after a preposition.

Next, **το αμάξι**... 'the car'. Another neuter noun, but one that demonstrates a common plural pattern. Similar to 'το παιδί' mentioned on page 46 in example VII, neuter nouns ending in -ι like 'αμάξι' or 'σπίτι' will add a unit in the plural, and the unstressed 'ι' often disappears phonetically.

Listen:
7. Το αμάξι είναι κόκκινο. 'The car is red.' Nominative singular.
8. Έχω το αμάξι. 'I have the car.' Accusative singular. No change.
9. Πάω με το αμάξι. 'I go by car.' Accusative singular, after a preposition.

In the plural:
10. Τα αμάξια είναι γρήγορα. 'The cars are fast.' Nominative plural.
11. Βλέπω τα αμάξια. 'I see the cars.' Accusative plural. Identical forms.
12. Είμαι μέσα στα αμάξια. 'I am inside the cars.' Accusative plural, after a preposition. Notice how 'μέσα σε' becomes 'μέσα στα'.

Similarly, **το σπίτι**... 'the house'. This also follows the pattern of neuter nouns ending in -ι.

Pay attention:
13. Το σπίτι είναι μεγάλο. 'The house is big.' Nominative singular.
14. Βρίσκω το σπίτι. 'I find the house.' Accusative singular. No change.
15. Μένω στο σπίτι. 'I live in the house.' Accusative singular, after a preposition. 'Σε' + 'το' becomes 'στο'.

And in the plural:
16. Τα σπίτια είναι μικρά. 'The houses are small.' Nominative plural.
17. Κοιτάζω τα σπίτια. 'I look at the houses.' Accusative plural. Identical.
18. Επιστρέφω στα σπίτια. 'I return to the houses.' Accusative plural, after a preposition. 'Σε' + 'τα' becomes 'στα'.

Finally, let's examine **τα λεφτά**... 'the money'. Chapter 3, page 47, cultural tip VIII explicitly states that Modern Greek nouns referring to money are *always* in the plural, unlike English where 'money' is singular.

Let's hear:
19. Τα λεφτά είναι σημαντικά. 'The money is important.' Nominative plural, serving as the subject.
20. Έχω τα λεφτά. 'I have the money.' Accusative plural, serving as the object.
21. Πληρώνω με τα λεφτά. 'I pay with the money.' Accusative plural, after a preposition.

As you can see, for neuter nouns, the nominative and accusative forms are identical in both singular and plural. Your primary task is to memorize the gender of each noun along with its initial nominative singular form... and then learn the appropriate plural ending.

Do not make the mistake of guessing gender from the ending alone, as the textbook warns on page 25. And remember, the context of the sentence determines which case to use, as Unit 3.2 carefully explains.

Practice these forms diligently. Repetition is key to mastery. Any questions? If not, start practicing!

The Negative! How to say 'No' inside a sentence. 

Use 'DEN'. 
Rule 1: Put it BEFORE the verb. 'Den exo' (I don't have). 
Rule 2: Don't be afraid of double negatives. 'Den thelo tipota' (I don't want nothing) is perfectly correct Greek. 

Note on Sound: You might hear 'De' instead of 'Den'. 'De thelo'. This happens when the next word starts with a continuous sound like 'th', 'v', 'l'. But 'Den' is always correct to write.

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: NEGATION [(See Page 35)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=35)

1. PLACEMENT: 'Den' always goes BEFORE the verb.
   - NOT 'Exo den'.
   - YES 'Den exo'.

2. DOUBLE NEGATIVE: Greek LOVES double negatives.
   - 'Den thelo tipota' = I don't want nothing. (Correct in Greek!)

3. PRONUNCIATION: The final 'n' in 'Den' is sometimes dropped in rapid speech before continuous consonants (De thelo), but writing 'Δεν' is always safe.

## Lesson 3.4: Location: 'In the' (Σε + Το = Στο)

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Location: 'In the' (Σε + Το = Στο)

INTRODUCTION:
Where are you? 

To answer this, you need the preposition 'Se'. But 'Se' is sticky. It glues itself to the Article.

Imagine 'Se' + 'To' (The). Smush them together: 'STO'. 
'Sto spiti' (In the house).

If the word is Feminine (H), use 'STIN'. 
'Stin Ellada' (In Greece).

If the word is Masculine (O), use 'STON'. 
'Ston dromo' (On the street).

This one little sound 'St-' covers 'In', 'At', 'On', and 'To'. Very efficient!

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: PREPOSITIONS [(See Page 72)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=72)

1. THE LITTLE WORD 'SE': It means 'in', 'at', or 'to'. 

2. COMBINATION: Greek hates small words next to each other. 'Se' combines with the 'The' (to/ton/tin).
   - Se + To -> STO (Neuter)
   - Se + Ton -> STON (Masculine)
   - Se + Tin -> STIN (Feminine)

3. MOVEMENT vs STATIC: It's the same! 
   - 'I go TO the house' = Pao STO spiti.
   - 'I stay IN the house' = Meno STO spiti.

## Lesson 4.1: Masculine Plurals (-os -> -oi)

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Masculine Plurals (-os -> -oi)

INTRODUCTION:
Plurals! Let's multiply our nouns. 

For Masculine nouns, we have two main groups.

Group 1: Words ending in -os (The big group). 
'O Dromos' becomes 'Oi Dromoi'. 
The 'os' turns into 'oi'. 

Group 2: Words ending in -as or -is. 
'O Antras' becomes 'Oi Antres'. 
'O Xartis' becomes 'Oi Xartes'. 
They both turn into 'es'.

Careful! 'Oi dromoi' (masculine) sounds exactly like 'Oi dromoi' (fem plural article? No, wait). 
Actually, the article 'Oi' is the same for Masculine and Feminine in plural. 
'Oi dromoi' (The streets - Masc). 
'Oi ores' (The hours - Fem). 
This is why you must know the Gender from the singular!

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: MASCULINE PLURALS [(See Page 44)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=44)

1. THE RULE OF -OS: Most masculine nouns end in -os. 
   - In Plural, -os becomes -oi. (Dromos -> Dromoi).

2. THE RULE OF -AS/-IS: Nouns ending in -as or -is follow a different pattern.
   - In Plural, they both become -es. (Antras -> Antres, Xartis -> Xartes).

3. ACCUSATIVE: When they are objects (after verbs/prepositions):
   - -os nouns become -ous. (Tous dromous).
   - -as/-is nouns become -es. (Tous antres - same as Nominative!)

## Lesson 4.2: The Plural Articles (O -> Oi)

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: The Plural Articles (O -> Oi)

INTRODUCTION:
The Article is King, even in Plural. 

For Masculine nouns:
- The Subject (Nominative) 'O' changes to 'Oi'. 
- The Object (Accusative) 'Ton' changes to 'Tous'.

So: 'O filos' (The friend) -> 'Oi filoi' (The friends). 
'Ton filo' (The friend, object) -> 'Tous filous'. 

Pay attention to 'Tous'. It is a very strong, masculine sound. If you hear 'Tous', you know it's a Masculine Plural Object. 
'Vlepo tous filous' (I see the friends).

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: PLURAL ARTICLES [(See Page 45)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=45)

1. NOMINATIVE: 'O' becomes 'Oi'. 
   - Note: 'Oi' is pronounced exactly like 'H' (ee). 
   - So 'Oi dromoi' sounds like 'Ee dromoi'.

2. ACCUSATIVE: 'Ton' becomes 'Tous'.
   - This is very distinctive. 'Tous' always marks a Masculine Plural Object.

3. FUSION: In the plural nominative, Masculine 'Oi' looks identical to Feminine 'Oi'. 
   - Masculine: Oi dromoi.
   - Feminine: Oi ores.

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: 'There is' / 'There are' (Υπάρχει)

INTRODUCTION:
When you want to say something exists, use 'Yparxei'. 

It comes from 'Ypo' (Under) + 'Arxi' (Beginning). Deep stuff. 

But you just need to know two forms:
1. 'Yparxei' (There is). Use this for one thing. 'Yparxei ena spiti'.
2. 'Yparxoun' (There are). Use this for many things. 'Yparxoun polla spitia'.

In questions, just use the voice tone: 'Yparxei provlima?' (Is there a problem?). 
And the negative: 'Den yparxei' (There isn't).

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: EXISTENCE [(See Page 51)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=51)

1. THE VERB 'YPARXO': It means 'To Exist'. 
   - We use it for 'There is' / 'There are'.

2. AGREEMENT: 
   - If the main noun is Singular, use 'Yparxei'.
   - If the main noun is Plural, use 'Yparxoun'.

3. NEGATION: Use 'Den'.
   - 'Den yparxei' (There isn't).
   - 'Den yparxoun' (There aren't).

## Lesson 5.1: Feminine Plurals (-a/-i -> -es)

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Feminine Plurals (-a/-i -> -es)

INTRODUCTION:
Feminine Plurals are the easiest in Greek. 

Whether the word ends in Alpha (H gynaika) or Eta (H timi), the plural ending is always '-es'.
- Oi gynaikes.
- Oi times.

The Article changes too:
- 'H' becomes 'Oi' (Subject).
- 'Tin' becomes 'Tis' (Object).

Pay attention to the Accusative 'Tis'. 
'Tis' is clearly feminine plural. 
If you say 'Tous' (Masc), people expect men. 
If you say 'Tis' (Fem), people expect women or feminine things. 
'Vlepo TIS files mou' (I see my girlfriends).

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: FEMININE PLURALS [(See Page 44)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=44)

1. THE 'GOLDEN RULE': Feminine nouns are easy in plural. 
   - Almost ALL of them end in -es.

2. ARTICLE CHANGES:
   - Nominative: 'H' becomes 'Oi'. (H ora -> Oi ores).
   - Accusative: 'Tin' becomes 'Tis'. (Tin ora -> Tis ores).

3. PRONUNCIATION:
   - 'Oi' (Nom) and 'H' (Sing) sound identical (ee).
   - 'Tis' (Acc) is distinct. You can hear the 's'.

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Neuter Plurals (-o -> -a)

INTRODUCTION:
Neuter nouns are special. 

First, the Article is simple: 'To' becomes 'Ta'. 
And importantly: Neuter Nouns are IDENTICAL in Subject and Object. 
'Ta vivlia einai edo' (subject). 'Exo ta vivlia' (object). No change!

The Noun Endings have 3 distinct groups:
1. Words in -o become -a. (Vuvlio -> Vivlia).
2. Words in -i become -ia. (Spiti -> Spitia). Don't forget the 'i' sound!
3. Words in -ma grow longer. They become -mata. 
   - 'To Onoma' (Name) -> 'Ta Onomata'. 
   - 'To Mathima' (Lesson) -> 'Ta Mathimata'.

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: NEUTER PLURALS [(See Page 45)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=45)

1. THE ARTICLE: Always 'Ta'. 
   - Singular: To. Plural: Ta. 
   - Easy!

2. GROUP 1 (-o -> -a): 
   - Just change the o to a. (Vivlio -> Vivlia).

3. GROUP 2 (-i -> -ia): 
   - Add an alpha. (Paidi -> Paidia).

4. GROUP 3 (-ma -> -mata):
   - These words get longer! They add a syllable.
   - Onoma -> Onomata.

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Shopping: Countable vs Uncountable

INTRODUCTION:
Let's go shopping. 

When you order, you often turn uncountable things (like coffee) into countable things (cups of coffee).

'Enan kafe' (One coffee - Accusative Masc).
'Dyo kafedes' (Two coffees). Note the -es ending for nouns in -es.

'Ena nero' (One water).
'Dyo nera' (Two waters).

And asking for the price:
Use 'Posso kanei' for one thing. 
Use 'Posso kanoun' for many things. 

Tip: 'Kalamaki' means 'Small reed'. In Athens, it's a straw. It's also a meat skewer (Souvlaki). 
'Dyo kalamakia' = Two straws OR Two skewers. Context is key!

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: COUNTING & PRICES [(See Page 46)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=46)

1. UNCOUNTABLES: Words like Water (Nero), Coffee (Kafes), Cheese (Tyri).
   - Usually Singular. 
   - But in ordering, we pluralize them to mean 'portions' or 'bottles'.
   - 'Dyo kafedes' = Two coffees.

2. HOW MUCH?: Use the verb 'Kano' (To do/make).
   - Posso kanei? (Singular)
   - Posso kanoun? (Plural)

3. LOANWORDS: Some words don't change!
   - To toast -> Ta toast.

## Lesson 6.1: Adjectives: Good, Big, Small

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Adjectives: Good, Big, Small

INTRODUCTION:
Adjectives give color to our world. In Greek, they are chameleons. They change to match the noun they sit next to.

Take 'Kalos' (Good).
If it's with a masculine noun (Filos), it stays 'Kalos'.
If it's with a feminine noun (Fili), it becomes 'Kali'.
If it's with a neuter noun (Vivlio), it becomes 'Kalo'.

So you have three forms for every adjective: -OS, -H, -O.

'Megalos' (Big).
- Megalos dromos.
- Megali poli.
- Megalo spiti.

Always check the Article! If you see 'To', you know the adjective must end in 'o'. 'To Megalo'.

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: ADJECTIVE AGREEMENT [(See Page 66)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=66)

1. MIRRORING: The adjective MUST mirror the Noun.
   - If noun is Masc, Adjective is Masc (-os).
   - If noun is Fem, Adjective is Fem (-i).
   - If noun is Neut, Adjective is Neut (-o).

2. PLACEMENT: Before the noun.
   - O kalos filos (Correct).
   - O filos kalos (Incorrect/Poetic).

3. THE ARTICLE: The Article leads the way.
   - O ... kalos ... noun.
   - H ... kali ... noun.

## Lesson 6.2: Colors (Adjectives Part 2)

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Colors (Adjectives Part 2)

INTRODUCTION:
Colors! 

We have two types of colors in Greek.

Type 1: The 'Normal' Adjectives. 
- Black (Mavros), White (Aspros), Red (Kokkinos), Green (Prasinos).
- These change endings. 'Mavros skylos' but 'Mavri gata'.
- 'Kokkino' usually ends in 'o' for Neutral, but 'Kokkinos' for Masculine.

Type 2: The 'Foreign/Invariant' Colors.
- Blue (Ble), Pink (Roz), Purple (Mov).
- These NEVER change. 
- 'H ble thalassa' (The blue sea).
- 'To ble vivlio' (The blue book).

Easy, right? Just remember which ones change!

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: COLORS [(See Page 82)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=82)

1. THE CHANGERS: Most colors act like normal adjectives (-os/i/o).
   - Black, White, Red, Green, Yellow (Kitrinos).

2. THE STUBBORN ONES: Some colors never change.
   - Blue (Ble), Pink (Roz), Purple (Mov), Grey (Gkri).
   - They stay the same for Masc, Fem, Plural, Singular.
   - 'O ble dromos', 'H ble thalassa'.

3. ORANGE/COFFEE: 
   - Portokali (Orange) and Kafe (Brown) look like they have endings, but they are usually treated as invariable or have special declensions. For A1, treat them as invariable.

KEY VOCABULARY:
- Μαύρος (Black)
- Άσπρος (White)
- Κόκκινος (Red)
- Πράσινος (Green)
- Κίτρινος (Yellow)
- Γαλάζιος (Light Blue)

**Paste this into NotebookLM "Add Source" (Paste Text) or Upload as PDF**:

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Agreement Drills

INTRODUCTION:
Now we check if you were listening. Agreement!

If the noun is Plural, the Adjective MUST be Plural.

'Oi kaloi filoi' (The good friends).
'Oi kales gynaikes' (The good women).
'Ta kala vivlia' (The good books).

Notice the rhyme?
- Kaloi ... Filoi (-oi)
- Kales ... Gynaikes (-es)
- Kala ... Vivlia (-a)

Greek loves rhyme. If it rhymes, it's usually grammatically correct (for standard nouns)!

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: PLURAL ADJECTIVES [(See Page 82)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=82)

1. MASCULINE PLURAL (-oi)
   - O kalos -> Oi kaloi.

2. FEMININE PLURAL (-es)
   - H kali -> Oi kales.

3. NEUTER PLURAL (-a)
   - To kalo -> Ta kala.

Note: These endings (-oi, -es, -a) match the Noun endings exactly for the standard noun groups!

Let's count money. 

The tens are easy once you learn them. 
Trianta (30), Saranta (40), Peninta (50)... notice the '-nta' ending.

- 1: Ena (Neut) vs Enas (Masc).
- 3: Tria (Neut) vs Treis (Masc/Fem).
- 4: Tessera (Neut) vs Tessereis (Masc/Fem).

Normally for money (Euro), we use Neuter forms. 
'Tria Evro'. 'Tessera Evro'.

But if you count people... 'Treis anthropoi' (3 people). 'Tessereis gynaikes' (4 women).

And 'Evro' never changes. Don't add an 's'!

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: NUMBERS [(See Page 82)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=82)

***SOURCE DATA START***
TOPIC: Adverbs of Place (Pano, Kato, Mesa)

INTRODUCTION:
Where is it? 

To answer this, words like 'In', 'On', 'Under' are key.

In Greek, these small words (Adverbs) need a partner.

Most use 'Se' (Sto/Stin/Ston):
- 'Pano sto trapezi' (On the table).
- 'Mesa stin tsanta' (Inside the bag).
- 'Konta sto spiti' (Near the house).

But some use 'Apo' (From):
- 'Exo apo to spiti' (Outside of the house).
- 'Kato apo to trapezi' (Under the table).

Memorize the pairs: Pano-Sto, Kato-Apo!

GRAMMAR NOTES:
GRAMMAR: LOCATION [(See Page 73)](/assets/grammar.pdf#page=73)

1. THE 'SE' GROUP (Location/Destination):
   - Pano se (On)
   - Mesa se (In/Inside)
   - Dipla se (Next to)
   - Konta se (Near)
   Remember: 'Se' combines with articles! (Pano Sto, Mesa Stin).

2. THE 'APO' GROUP (Separation/Distance):
   - Kato apo (Under/Below - oddly uses 'from')
   - Exo apo (Outside of)
   - Makria apo (Far from)

'Pos' is How. 'Pos pas?' (How are you going - by car/bus?).

But 'Poios' behaves like an adjective! 
- 'Poios (Masc) einai?'
- 'Poia (Fem) einai?'
- 'Poio (Neut) einai?' (e.g., Which child?).
