PREFACE
This book is aimed at being a comprehensive grammar of Modern Greek for levels A1-A2. 
It is designed primarily for absolute beginners, but also for people who want to refresh their 
knowledge of levels A1-A2. It might, however, be suitable as a reference for teachers of Mod-
ern Greek or for people who just wish to have a general idea of Modern Greek starting from a 
basic grammar. The book can be used as a companion for any relevant coursebook, either for 
self-study or for learning in class.
Grammar points are presented in an everyday style, which echoes teaching in class, with the 
minimum of grammar terminology. They are supported by real-life examples (translated into 
English), which come together with their oral version. Considering that this material is basical-
ly addressed to non-natives, it includes much more than what is considered to be traditionally 
part of a grammar: morphology and syntax combine with comments on semantics-pragmatics, 
while phonetics/phonology are a necessary complement of the entire book. Regarding the phe-
nomena under consideration, the book highlights those points that might be problematic for 
non-natives. Learners are not only introduced to the phenomena per se. They are also directed 
to the reasoning process they should develop in order to handle them in use and be communica-
tively effective. Regarding practice, learners are encouraged to take a realistic point of view: 
Errors are part of learning anyway, and sometimes the awareness of a phenomenon is in itself 
enough for levels A1-A2.
The book is structured in 11 Chapters. Chapter 1 introduces pronunciation and writing. 
Nouns and verbs are prominent regarding grammar and communication, so they are taken 
as general guidelines in Chapter 2. Nouns are further examined in Chapters 3 and 10, while 
Chapters 5 and 6 introduce modifiers of nouns and pronouns. Verbs in turn are further exam -
ined in Chapters 4, 8 and 9, with their modifiers being examined in Chapter 7. Chapter 11 is a 
grammar-free chapter, focusing on peculiarities of the Modern Greek vocabulary. Each chapter 
comes with exercises for elementary practice and cultural tips of linguistic relevance, as well 
as its translation in Modern Greek. The book also incorporates an Appendix with basic verbs 
for levels A1-A2, a glossary in the form of a continuous text with key words and examples, as 
well as basic links that learners of levels A1-A2 might wish to follow.
This book came out as a result of my teaching experience with incoming ERASMUS stu -
dents of the University of Crete. Earlier drafts of this material were used in the EILC summer 
courses for the period 2009-2013. I would like to thank Y . Frangiadakis and Ei. Kanellopoulou, 
who spent their summer evenings reading these drafts.

CHAPTER 1 | The Basics
This book is a user-friendly grammar of Modern Greek. It aims to be a comprehensive navi -
gator, which will help absolute beginners like you get inside the world of Modern Greek and 
explore it safely. I guess that this world is hardly known to most of you, so a brief introduction 
might help. (But if this is too much for you or you believe you can do without it, skip this page 
and go directly to Unit 1.1 on page 2.)
Modern Greek is the official language of Greece and one of the official languages of Cyprus. 
It is spoken today as a first or second language by 12-15 million people, not only in Greece and 
Cyprus, but also in countries with minority or immigrant communities of Greek origin (such as 
the USA, Canada, Australia, Germany, Georgia, Ukraine etc.). Modern Greek is also one of the 
official languages of the European Union.
As a descendant of Ancient Greek, Modern Greek belongs to an independent branch of the 
Indo-European language family. Compared to its ancestor, Modern Greek has a relatively sim-
pler phonological system, with only five vowels and numerous consonants. Stress in Modern 
Greek is dynamic and restricted to one of the three final syllables of the word. Typologically, 
Modern Greek is an inflectional language, which means that grammatical information (such 
as number, case, tense, aspect etc.) is indicated by the endings of inflected words (nouns, pro-
nouns, articles, adjectives, verbs). One of the main syntactic features of Modern Greek is free 
word order: The major constituents of the sentence (such as the subject, the verb or the object) 
may occupy different positions within it. Sentences with identical major constituents in a dif -
ferent order share roughly the same meaning but not the same focus (emphasis). Compounding 
and derivation are two of the major mechanisms of word formation, which explains why many 
words, even very common ones, are rather lengthy. Compared to English, reading in Modern 
Greek is easy. All you have to do is learn what each letter (or combination of letters) of the 
Greek alphabet represents, and then put things together in practice. Spelling, though, is not that 
easy. Unlike consonants, vowels are represented in various ways, and this might be a problem 
in terms of writing correctly (but there are rules to help you).
Like with any language, learning Modern Greek means developing certain skills. For in -
stance, one must be able to understand what other people say, communicate with them, read, 
write, spell etc. All of these skills are important, but some are more important than others. 
Understanding and speaking (skills related to oral communication) are more important than 
reading and writing (skills related to written communication). If Ι master Italian, for example, 
what Ι will say is I speak Italian rather than I write Italian. Besides, there are people who speak 
fluently and cannot read or write a word. 
Although less important, reading and writing are absolutely necessary in the learning con -

text you have chosen here (and there are several such contexts around). This is an e-book, 
which is a book after all, and what you see is a grammar, typically a written text. In this learn-
ing context, reading and writing are necessary as a first step to oral communication. So let’s 
start with them. 
1.1 The Greek Alphabet
The Greek alphabet consists of 24 letters, all in a capital and a small version. Small letters may 
differ from capital ones. Writing goes from left to right. Calligraphy (a Greek word) is not 
widespread these days, and hand writing does not differ radically from typing. Some letters are 
similar to letters of the Latin and the Cyrillic alphabets, a fact that makes life easier, but still 
might cause confusion.
It’s now time to go through the Greek alphabet. Each letter (both capital and small) is in -
troduced as a typing font. If you press on it, you can hear its pronunciation, by a female and 
a male voice. (If you press here you can see the hand-written version of the alphabet on You -
Tube.) English words are used as examples of pronunciation whenever possible. Keep in mind, 
though, that there is always some difference between the two languages. The names of the 
letters are not crucial at the moment, so stay focused on phonetics.
GREEK LETTER DESCRIPTION AND COMMENTS
A/α
The letter A/α represents a short [a], like in hat. (There are no long vowels 
in Modern Greek.) From now on I will use [a] as a support sound in order to 
introduce consonants.
Β/β This letter is not a [b], as you might expect. It’s a [v], like in vase.
Γ/γ
The sound represented by Γ/γ has no equivalent in English. It is closer to 
the initial sound of the French word rendez-vous (and, please, check google.
translate for the real French pronunciation). Note that the small-letter version 
of the typing font has no inner space at the bottom.
Δ/δ This letter represents [δ] like in than.
Ε/ε E/ε stands for [e], like in pen.
Ζ/ζ
I believe it is really easy to relate the capital letter to [z], like in zoo. In order 
to write the small letter, first draw a horizontal line and then go on with a final 
s.
Η/η The letter Η/η represents a short [i], like in tip.
Θ/θ This letter stands for [θ], like in thin.
Table 1.1: The Greek Alphabet: Letters and Their Phonetic Representation.

--- Page 12 ---

Chapter 1 | The Basics
Page 3
GREEK LETTER DESCRIPTION AND COMMENTS
Ι/ι
The letter again represents [i] like in tip (see H/η). So far two different letters, 
Η/η and Ι/ι, represent exactly the same sound. Conversely, if you hear [i] 
you cannot tell which letter denotes it. At this point you might wonder why 
two different letters should be used for an identical sound, and here is the 
answer: The Modern Greek writing system preserves in some respects the 
Ancient Greek tradition, and in Ancient Greek the two letters stood for dif -
ferent sounds. Now the phonetic difference is gone, but the writing difference 
is still here. 
Κ/κ This letter stands for an unaspirated [k] sound which is close to book. 
Λ/λ Here we have an [l] that is closer to the light [l] of like and not the dark [l] of 
little.
Μ/μ It is easy to relate the capital M to an [m] sound like in make. In order to write 
the small letter, first draw a vertical line, then something close to the Latin u.
Ξ/ξ
What we have here is a double consonant, namely [ks], like in ox. In order to 
write the small letter, first draw a horizontal line, then a semicircle, and then 
a final s.
Ν/ν This letter stands for [n], like in noise.
Ο/ο The letter Ο/ο represents a short [o], like in top.
Π/π This letter represents an unaspirated [p] sound, like in stop. 
Ρ/ρ
The sound represented by Ρ/ρ is significantly different from the pronuncia -
tion of the English [r] in tropical, and closer to the Italian or the Spanish [r] 
in Roberto or Ramόn (if you don’t speak Italian or Spanish, check google.
translate for the correct pronunciation). In order to produce [r] the tip of the 
tongue must take a frontal position and loosely touch the area over the teeth 
of the upper jaw. 
Σ/σ (-ς)
This letter represents an [s] sound, like in see. Notice that [s] has two small-let-
ter versions. When [s] is word-final, it is written as -ς. In other positions it is 
written as σ. 
Τ/τ The letter Τ/τ stands for an unaspirated [t] sound, like in spot. 
Υ/υ This letter is the third representation of the sound [i] like in tip. Now you have 
three letters to worry about.
Φ/φ The letter Φ/φ stands for [f], like in fish.
Χ/χ The sound represented by Χ/χ is close to ham or the Scottish loch, but really 
closer to the Spanish jamόn (check again google.translate). 
Table 1.1: The Greek Alphabet: Letters and Their Phonetic Representation.

Chapter 1 | The Basics
Page 4
GREEK LETTER DESCRIPTION AND COMMENTS
Ψ/ψ The letter Ψ/ψ represents a double consonant, namely [ps]. The sound is close 
to stops.
Ω/ω
This is the last (but not least) letter of the Greek alphabet. Ω/ω again rep -
resents [o] like in top. Note that the capital version of the typing font is differ-
ent from the hand-written version.

Confusing Letters 
When reading or writing Modern Greek, remember: Β/β is not B/b, it represents [v]. H/η 
is not H or n, it represents [i]. The small-letter version of Ν/ν is not v, since this letter rep-
resents [n]. Ρ/ρ is clearly not P/p, it is [r]. Finally Υ/υ stand for [i] and Χ/χ stand for [h].
Common Mistakes in Absolute-Beginner Writing
• In the small-letter version of Τ/τ the vertical line does not exceed the horizontal line 
like in the Latin t.
• The small-letter version of Υ/υ has no additional line like the Latin u. And its bottom is 
circular, not angular. If you make it angular what you will have is ν, that is [n].
• Unlike the Latin I/i, the small-letter version of Ι has no dot on top (ι).
Small and Capital Letters
• Small-letter words are spelled with an initial capital letter when they start a sentence.
• All proper nouns are also spelled with an initial capital: Names of persons, months, 
days of the week (unlike French). Abstract nouns (such as justice) and concrete nouns 
(such as table) are spelled with an initial small letter.
• The full stop (.), the comma (,), the exclamation mark (!) and the ellipsis (...) are iden-
tical to the ones used in the Latin alphabet. The Greek interrogation mark (;) as well as 
quotation marks («__») are different.
It is now time to practice. First try to read and then press on the word to check pronunciation. 

--- Page 14 ---

Chapter 1 | The Basics
Page 5
Meaning is irrelevant at the moment so again focus on phonetics. Here are some really short 
words to start with. 
(1a)  με, μα, μη, σε, ας, πας, φας, πες, δες, λες 
(1b)  NA, AN, ΘΑ, TA, ΖΩ, ΔΕΝ, ΠΩΣ
In order to work with longer words, we need something more. Let me then introduce stress, a 
necessary complement of the Modern Greek phonetic system. 
1.2 Stress 
I will try to explain stress using a pair of words. These words consist of exactly the same 
sounds, in the same order (phonetically [pote]). Listen to them:
(2)  ΠΟΤΕ / ΠΟΤΕ 
Can you hear a difference? I hope your answer is “yes” (if it’s “no”, listen again). Why this 
difference? Because the vowels inside them seem to carry different weights. In the first word 
[o] is pronounced somewhat more loudly and a bit longer than [e]. In the second word this sort 
of emphasis is put on [e], which is now pronounced more loudly and longer than [o]. This is 
stress. 
Let’s turn to more examples. What you have to do now is listen to the following words and 
decide which vowel sounds stronger (and then go to example 5 on page 6 to see the marked 
vowel):
(3)  ΦΟΡΑ   ΦΟΡΑ
 AΘΗΝΑ  ΑΘΗΝΑ
 ΩΜΟΣ  ΩΜΟΣ
Words with identical phonetic structure like the previous ones are real words. And these words 
differ in meaning because of the stress. Π ΟΤΕ and ΠΟΤ Ε, for instance, mean “when” and 
“ever” (or “never”) respectively. Stress then affects meaning and therefore communication, a 
fact that goes significantly beyond these pairs of words (and several like them) and holds for 
every Modern Greek word. Stress actually works together with sounds to form the “profile” of 
each word. Errors of stress might then damage a word’s “profile” and cause confusion, or even 
destroy communication. At this moment you should stop worrying too much about your accent 
(I know you do) and start worrying about stress: No matter how “badly” you pronounce the 
Modern Greek γ (within certain limits, of course), people will certainly assume you are not a 
native (so what?), but they will understand what you are trying to say. If you mis-stress a word, 

--- Page 15 ---

Chapter 1 | The Basics
Page 6
people will simply not get what you mean. 
A few remarks about stress now:
• Stress is not fixed (like in French), but at least it is restricted to one of the last three syllables 
of the word. No matter how long a Greek word is (and there are several lengthy ones), the 
stress will never move beyond the third syllable.
(4) τηλεφώνημα  τηλεφωνία  τηλεφωνικός
           3  2  1            3  21            3  2 1
• Each word may bear only one stress (but see Unit 10.2.3 on page 145 for an exception).
• The stress is represented in small-letter writing (unfortunately not in capital letters) by an 
accent mark on the stressed vowel of the word. Let’s see the small-letter version of exam -
ples 2 and 3:
(5)  πότε/ποτέ, φόρα/φορά, Αθηνά/Αθήνα, ωμός/ώμος
The accent mark is there to indicate which vowel is stronger. Accordingly, it is not used in 
monosyllabic words (check example 1 on page 5). 
• As absolute beginners, you should keep in mind that the accent mark is not decoration. It is 
an obligatory part of writing, which will help you develop your stress awareness. 
Νote that the accent mark is not a dot, but looks more like an index.
1.3 Time for Practice
Having introduced stress, let’s practice now with some longer words: 
(6)  έλα, από, νερό, βάζω, μαμά, θέλω, δίνω, θύμα, 
 φυτό, ξέρω, ψάρι, πάμε, χαρά, τώρα, όταν
The following words are phonetically the same, but their stress is different. Read first and then 
listen:
(7)  νόμος/νομός, μόνος/μονός, θόλος/θολός, χάλι/χαλί, 
 κάλος/καλός, φίλη/φιλί, πόλη/πολύ, ράφι/ραφή 
Now, here are some longer words. Notice that the stress will always be on syllables 3-1: 

--- Page 16 ---

Chapter 1 | The Basics
Page 7
(8)  σήμερα, ποτήρι, απορώ, καλημέρα, τηλέφωνο, τηλεφωνώ, εφημερίδα
I kept some really long ones for the end. Take a long breath and start!
(9)  εξωτερικός, καταναλώνω, αλατοπίπερο, ενημερωμένος, παρατηρητικός, 
 αποδοτικότητα, ανεβοκατεβάζω, παραληρηματικός, περιχαρακωθήκαμε
Combinations of two or even three consonants are very common in Modern Greek:
(10a)  τρία, κράτος, κλίμα, χρώμα, πέφτω, πλένω, αφρός, 
 γλυκός, γνώμη, πράγμα, μνήμη, βρίσκω 
(10b)  άστρο, αστραπή, σπρώχνω, εχθρός, σκληρός, άνθρωπος, έμβρυο
Note that combinations of two identical consonants are pronounced exactly like the single 
consonant version.
(I)  αλλά, Ελλάδα (this is the word for Greece!), γράμμα, άρρωστος, ιπποπόταμος
The letter Σ/σ (-ς) always stands for [s] among vowels, either inside the word or across 
word boundaries. It represents [z] when followed by [m] or [v] (for a full list and examples 
press here: http://www.foundalis.com/lan/grphdetl.htm). Listen and compare:
(II)  άσε, όσα, πέρασα, θάλασσα, στόμα, σπόρος, σμήνος, σβήνω
Combinations of vowels are also possible:
(11)  ζωή, ζώα, μία, τρώω, αέρας, εννέα, περίεργος, αηδόνι 
Perhaps you have already noticed that the word-initial position may be kept by any sound. 
Final position, though, is usually kept by a vowel. The only consonants in word-final po-
sition are [s] and [n].
By now, you must have started to wonder whether there is a [b] or a [d] in Modern Greek. The 
answer lies in the following section. 
1.4 More Sounds
There are some sounds which are represented not by one letter but by a combination of two 
letters. These sounds may be consonants or vowels.

--- Page 17 ---

Chapter 1 | The Basics
Page 8
1.4.1 Consonants
• The combination μπ represents a [b] sound, which is close to book.
• The combination ντ represents a [d] sound, which is close to door.
• The combinations γκ/γγ represent a [g] sound, which is close to gum. (Notice that γγ is an 
exception to the rule about identical consonants. Remember? If not, check Unit 1.3 on page 
7).
• In word-intitial position μπ, ντ, γκ are pronounced like [b], [d] and [g]. Inside the word 
they may be pronounced like [b/mb], [d/nd], and [g/ng], and in this case you are free 
to use any one of them. What you cannot do is pronounce μπ like [mp], ντ like [nt] and 
γκ/γγ like [nk].
• Like other consonants (see Unit 1.3 on page 7), [b], [d] and [g] can combine with 
consonants (usually [r]): 
(III)  μπροστά, ντροπή, γκρίζος
Apart from single consonants like [b], [d], [g], there are two double consonants which are rep-
resented by two letters:
• Τhe combination τσ represents [ts]. 
• The combination τζ represents [dz].
Like [ks] and [ps], these consonants are produced by already existing single sounds, so they 
bring nothing new to the sound palette of Modern Greek.
I believe you are ready now to read the following words and then check pronunciation: 
(12)  μπορώ, ντύνω, γκάζι, αμπέλι, Αντώνης, φεγγάρι, ομπρέλα, 
 άντρας, γκρεμός, τσάντα, τσιμέντο, τζάμι, τζίτζικας
1.4.2 Vowels
There is only one new vowel here. This is [u], like in foot, which is represented by the combi-
nation ου. There are, though, other combinations to represent vowels you already know:
• The sound [i] is also represented by the combinations ει or οι. Now you have five rep -
resentations of [i] to worry about.
• The sound [e] is also represented by αι.
Now read the following words and check pronunciation. Note that the accent mark (if neces -
sary) falls on the second letter of the combination:

--- Page 18 ---

Chapter 1 | The Basics
Page 9
(13)  κάνει, μπορεί, ώμοι, ωμοί, είμαι, αίμα, ουρά, ούλα
The Double Dot
Combinations that represent consonants equal a single sound (or sounds). In other words, 
μπ is always [b/mb], etc. Combinations of vowels don’t. In other words, αι is most of the 
times [e], but could also be [ai]. How can you tell the difference while learning new words 
or while reading? These procedures involve writing, and a special mark is here to help.
(IV)  παιδάκι / παϊδάκι
The double dot on top of the second letter indicates that αι should be pronounced like [ai]. 
If the word is stressed on the first of the two vowels the accent mark by itself indicates 
separate pronunciation and the double dot is not necessary:
(V)  Μάιος 
When the combination has no accent mark or the accent mark is posited on the second 
letter, the letters represent a single sound (check the words of example 13).
• The double dot in writing is not decoration. In order to realize how important it is, go 
again to παιδάκι and παϊδάκι. The first word means “little child”, the second “lamb 
chop”.

Two Tricky Combinations: αυ/ευ
One of the most tricky parts of Greek spelling concerns the αυ/ευ combinations. Here the 
letter Υ/υ does not stand for a vowel but for a consonant (a unique case in Modern Greek 
writing). And, as if to make things worse, this consonant may be [v] or [f] according to the 
following sound:
• [v] when the following sound is voiced (voiced sounds are vowels, and consonants 
such as [l] or [r]).
• [f] when the following sound is voiceless (voiceless sounds are consonants such as [t], 
[k], [x]).
(VIa)  αυγό, αυλή, Παρασκευή, ευλογώ
(VIb)  αυτός, ευκολία, ευχαριστώ
(For a full list of voiced and unvoiced consonants press here: http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/
Appendix:Greek_pronunciation).
I kept the worst for the end: If the αυ/ευ is stressed, the accent mark falls on υ, a rather 
peculiar choice since the letter represents a consonant here:
(VII)  αύριο, εύκολος, Εύα
Notice that if the accent mark falls on the first letter of the combination, then the two 
sounds are pronounced separately and now Υ/υ represents a vowel:
(VIII)  άυπνος, άυλος
1.5 Synopsis
It is now time to summarize the basics of pronunciation (and writing). Sounds are followed by 
every possible writing representation (in small-letter writing), along with examples (meaning 
is not necessary at the moment, but I believe we need some fresh air after all these pages on 
pronunciation).
1.5.1 Vowels
The Modern Greek vowel system is a simple (elementary) system, consisting of 5 short vowels.
SOUND LETTER EXAMPLE
[a] α μαμά (“Mom”)
[e] ε, αι νερό (“water”)
παίζω (“to play”)

SOUND LETTER EXAMPLE
[i] η, ι, υ, ει, οι
ημέρα (“day”)
ίσως (“perhaps”)
ύψος (“height”)
είμαι (“to be”)
οικονομία (“economy”)
[o] ο, ω φοράω (“to wear”)
[u] ου ουρανός (“sky”)
Table 1.2: Modern Greek Vowels and Their Representation in Writing. 
For a technical representation of the vowel system press here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/
Modern_Greek_phonology .
Three of the above vowels have two or more writing representations. Considering that αι 
and ε, for example sound exactly the same, correct spelling seems quite tricky. There is 
no reason to panic: After all, you are not the first to deal with this problem. Generations of 
natives had to go through this at school. Besides, even if you write ε instead of αι people 
will get what you mean. Apart from this, you should keep in mind the following points:
• You can draw conclusions about spelling based on grammar. For instance nouns, ad-
jectives and pronouns are related to an o as part of their ending, while verbs are related 
to a final -ω.
• You can draw conclusions about spelling based on compounding and derivation. Words 
seem to keep their initial spelling in both cases (compare to human, humanity, humane, 
humanitarian), and this will also be a great help to you.
1.5.2 Consonants
The Modern Greek consonant system consists of 18 simple consonants and 4 double conso -
nants. Some consonants (namely 5) are represented by two letters and the rest by a single letter. 
But all of them (with one exception, [g]) have a single writing representation (considering the 
vowel system, this is a relief).

[b] μπ μπαμπάς (“Dad”)

1.5.3 Stress
In order to pronounce a word, stress is as necessary as sounds. Stress is single and restricted to 
one of the last three syllables of the word. Stress is a property of vowels. Consequently, only 
vowels can bear the accent mark in writing. 
1.6 Towards Perfection
Some sounds may be affected by surrounding sounds, or even affect them. In the present unit 
we shall examine such sounds. This is putting the final touch to your new perfect Modern 
Greek accent. Keep in mind, though, that lack of perfection will not destroy communication. 
Even if you only stick to the information given so far, or even if your pronunciation is not ideal, 

--- Page 22 ---

Chapter 1 | The Basics
Page 13
people will still understand what you are trying to say.
1.6.1 Four Consonants…
Listen to the following words: 
(14)  κρύος, καλός, ακόμα, ακούω
The sound [k] in these words is close to the [k] sound in the word book. Now check the fol -
lowing words:
(15)  κερί, κεράσι, άκυρος, κοιμάμαι 
Here [k] sounds different. Actually it sounds more like cute than like book. Now try to read 
these words. When you pronounce the words of the first group, your tongue seems to take a 
position in the back of the mouth. But when you pronounce the words of the second group, the 
tongue seems to take a frontal position.
This is an instance of a rule affecting four consonants, namely [k], [g], [h], [γ]. These con -
sonants keep their initial pronunciation (as introduced in Tables 1.1 on page 2 and 1.3 on 
page 11) when they are followed either by a consonant or by the vowels [a], [o], [u]. Their 
pronunciation becomes frontal when they are followed by the vowels [i] and [e].
Here are more examples to listen to and practice:
(16a)  κλειστός, καλά, κόρη, κούραση / κενός, κύμα
(16b)  χρώμα, χαρά, χώμα, αχούρι / χέρι, χύμα
(16c)  γράφω, γάλα, γόνατο, γουρούνι / γέρος, γύρος
(16d)  γκρεμός, φεγγάρι, αγκώνας, αγγούρι / άγγελος, άγκυρα
1.6.2 ...and a Vowel
Listen to the following word:
(17)  παιδεία
Do you hear the [i] after the [δ] sound? Yes, you do. Now listen to the following word:
(18)  παιδιά
Do you hear the [i] sound now? I know it is hard, because writing is misleading at this point, so 
forget about writing and focus on listening again (and again, if necessary). What you really hear 
instead of [i] is a [j], like in the word γύρος (phonetically, the word is represented as [peδja]). 

--- Page 23 ---

Chapter 1 | The Basics
Page 14
Listen now to the following word:
(19)  δουλεία
The [i] after the [l] sound is clear. What about the following word? 
(20)  δουλειά
The [i] seems to be totally gone, I mean there is nothing left in its position. Instead, something 
has happened to the previous sound. Listen again: It is not the ordinary [l] (see Tables 1.1 on 
page 2 and 1.3 on page 11) but another kind of [l] sound.
This is just an instance of a general phonetic tendency of Modern Greek to eliminate vowel 
combinations: When followed by another vowel, unstressed [i] has two options:
• One is to transform into a consonant, like in the word παιδιά. 
• The other one is to disappear, affecting the previous consonant, like in the word δουλειά.
I will not go into details at this point, partly to save you time and energy, and partly because 
I believe you can do it (but if you want to read more press here http://www.foundalis.com/lan/
grphdetl.htm , Unit Palatalization). Try to read the letters in bold like one syllable, then check 
pronunciation.
(21a)  χωριά, κάποιος, καμιά, πρωτιά, βαθιά, ήπια
(21b)  γλυκιά, ήλιος, οχιά, μαγκιά
1.7 Beyond Words
Producing single words does not equate producing them together, as parts of a sentence. Inside 
a sentence words may undergo several changes not examined in the previous units. A sentence 
may also have additional properties that have not been discussed so far. This is what we are 
going to do here. 
1.7.1 “Words” Larger than Words
I think it is now time for your first Modern Greek sentence. But let me first introduce Πέτρος 
( 
  ), one of the main characters in the examples of this book. 
(22)  O Πέτρος είναι από την Αθήνα. 
 “(-) Peter is from (-) Athens.”
Let me first explain the sentence. Είναι corresponds to the verb “is”, από is a preposition mean-

--- Page 24 ---

Chapter 1 | The Basics
Page 15
ing “from”, Αθήνα is Athens. The words O/την are articles, equivalent to the English the, and 
in Modern Greek they combine with every noun, including proper nouns (the hyphen signals 
the missing article in the English translation). Try to read it now and then press on the sentence. 
What do you hear? If I had to change writing to represent hearing, the sentence would be some-
what like this:
(23) ΟΠέτρος  /  είναι  /  αποτηνΑθήνα
 [opetros   ine   apotinaθina]
Phonetically speaking, the boundary among some words seems to be lost. These words are 
now coming together, to form one larger phonetic unit. Considering that this unit bears only 
one stress (indicated by the vowel in bold), what we have here is a new “word”, larger than 
ordinary words. 
• Keep in mind that the components of such units are not random. In other words, you cannot 
split sentence 22 like this:
(24) 
  OΠετροςείναι / απότην / Αθήνα
• As a rule, “grammatical” words (like articles or prepositions) seem to lose their status as 
independent words and “stick” to “lexical” words (like nouns or verbs) on their side. Let’s 
take the preposition από. In a process like this, από turns into απο-. It becomes something 
like a prefix (compare to un-known) losing its stress.
Let’s go now to another sentence:
(25) Ο Πέτρος έκλεισε την πόρτα.
 “(-) Peter closed the door.”
Έκλεισε is “closed”, την πόρτα is “the door” (the hyphen again signals the missing article in 
the English translation). I think it is easy to split the sentence into 3 phonetic units, namely 
ΟΠέτρος / έκλεισε / τηνπόρτα. I want you now to focus on the third unit and listen carefully.
(26) τηνπόρτα
What you have really heard is not [np]. What you heard is an [mb].
(27) [timborta]

--- Page 25 ---

Chapter 1 | The Basics
Page 16
Ι will spare the technical explanation, but if you want to know what happens press here: http://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_Greek_phonology. The point is that phonetic units may under-
go changes similar to those inside real words (compare to im-possible, ir-resistible), and this is 
not a peculiarity of Modern Greek. If you go back to your native tongue I am sure you will find 
similar phenomena (a Greek word again).  
1.7.2 Intonation
Let’s start with a sentence about the weather:
(28) (-) βρέχει.
 “It is raining.”
This is an elementary sentence, consisting of only one verb (weather verbs have no subject, and 
the hyphen represents the missing subject in Modern Greek). 
This sentence could be pronounced like this:
(29) Βρέχει.
 “It is raining.” 
But also like this:
(30) Βρέχει;
 “Is it raining?” 
The first sentence is clearly a statement, while the second sentence is a question. As you see 
intonation, the “melodic” structure that pervades a sentence, is enough to affect sentence inter-
pretation in Modern Greek, and therefore meaning (compare to English, where questions have 
to undergo syntactic changes as well).
Intonation may also uncover the speaker’s attitude towards what the sentence means. Listen to 
the following sentences:
(31a) Βρέχει! 
(31b) Βρέχει! 
(31c) Βρέχει...
(31d) Βρέχει... 
(31e) Βρέχει...
All of the above are statements about the rain. One of them expresses irony (my mother is 

--- Page 26 ---

Chapter 1 | The Basics
Page 17
complaining about the rain and I believe she is exaggerating). One expresses surprise (I read 
the weather forecast and I was sure it would be a sunny day). One expresses a warning (my 
daughter is ready to go out wearing a t-shirt). One expresses disappointment (I was ready for a 
picnic). And another one expresses delight (now I am a farmer waiting for the rain to water the 
field). Can you find out which is which? (Here are the correct answers: Irony is 31d, surprise is 
31a, warning is 31e, disappointment is 31c, and delight is 31b).
• Punctuation marks represent intonation in writing. The full stop represents simple 
statements, questions are marked by the interrogation mark, and surprise is expressed 
by the exclamation mark. Sarcasm/irony or disappointment are expressed by the ellip-
sis mark. 
• Word stress is not affected by intonation. Phonetic units like the ones in 31a-31e will 
keep their original stress no matter what sort of intonation is imposed on the sentence.
1.7.3 Focus 
Let’s see the following sentence:
(32) O Πέτρος έφαγε τα ψάρια. 
 “ (-) Peter ate the fish.”
Έφαγε is “ate”, τα ψάρια is “the fish”. The rest you already know. This is a statement bearing 
the information you read in the English translation.
Listen now to the following sentence:
(33) Ο ΠΕΤΡΟΣ έφαγε τα ψάρια.
 “It is Peter who ate the fish.”
This is again a statement conveying the same information (“Peter ate the fish”). But the focus 
(emphasis, signaled in speech by louder voice) on the phrase Ο Πέτρος gives the second sen -
tence an additional contrastive reading: It was Peter (and not the cat, for example) who ate the 
fish. Here again, like in intonation, the (phonetic) emphasis on a part of the sentence is enough 
to produce contrast (compare to English).
Focus may affect other parts of the sentence, which are not in initial position:
(34) O Πέτρος έφαγε ΤΑ ΨΑΡΙΑ.
 “It was the fish Peter ate.”

--- Page 27 ---

Chapter 1 | The Basics
Page 18
Now the contrastive reading starts from the phrase τα ψάρια. It was the fish Peter ate, (and not, 
for example, the soup). 
• There is no special punctuation mark to signal focus in writing. Sometimes italics or 
capital letters do the job.
• Like in intonation, stress is not affected by focus. But since everything must be louder, 
stress will be much louder, too.
At this point I must make something clear: Nobody expects you at this moment to handle sen-
tence pronunciation, intonation or focus. This will come with time and practice. The point of 
Unit l.7 was to help you develop some sort of sentence-pronunciation awareness, that’s all. If 
by now you are able to read and pronounce single words, then you have achieved the basic aim 
of this chapter, and it is time to go on to the next one.
Yes and No
Modern Greek “yes” (ναι) sounds more like “no”. Many people get confused in the begin-
ning when they hear ναι, but then they get used to it. You’ll get used to it, too. Just remem-
ber that the Modern Greek “no” is όχι.
People may say “yes” or “no” using body language. For “no” people raise their head, 
and/or raise their eyebrows. They may also use a sound like “ts” inhaling air. In terms of 
“yes”, people usually nod. This type of motion may be close to the vertical axis, starting 
from just a bit to the left and ending just a bit to the right (from your perspective).
Shouting
Who said there are no long vowels in Modern Greek? Listen to this:
(IX) Πέτροοοο! Eλένηηηη!
These long vowels are not real vowels; they are just an instance of shouting. People often 
shout at each other, and this is not necessarily a sign of offensive or aggressive behavior. 
Keep in mind that the Greek culture is an open-air culture, and sometimes a loud voice is 
necessary in order for someone to be audible.
SUMMARY
Chapter 1 aims at developing elementary skills for language learning like pronunciation, and 
reading/writing. The Greek alphabet is the starting point for the introduction of the Modern 
Greek sounds, which work together with stress to form the phonetic “profile” of any Modern

Chapter 2 | Nouns and Verbs
Page 21
CHAPTER 2 | Nouns and Verbs
Nouns and verbs are Very Important Parts of any language. Take the words water and drink. 
These words describe basic facts of human experience. These words can stand alone to form 
elementary meaningful sentences such as Water! or Drink! Therefore such words are basic for 
communication and usually come first in language learning (any teacher in her/his right mind 
would introduce water and drink prior to curious or nevertheless). Modern Greek is not an 
exception in this respect. 
Modern Greek nouns and verbs are inflected words. Therefore, apart from their (lexical) 
meaning, they come with lots of grammar inside them. In the following units I shall introduce 
basic grammatical features for each one of these groups, focusing on those features that seem 
to be less evident for learners of Modern Greek.
2.1 The Grammar of Nouns
Modern Greek nouns are present in speech in different forms. Here is an example:
(1) δρόμος  δρόμοι
 “street”  “streets”
Different forms of the same noun share a common left part (δρόμ- in our example), which bears 
the lexical meaning of the noun. Checking this left part (or stem of the noun) I can tell that this 
noun means “street”. Their right part (- ος or -οι in our example) bears grammatical informa -
tion about the noun. Checking the right side (or ending of the noun) I can tell for instance that 
δρόμος is in the singular and δρόμοι is in the plural. 
Number, gender and case are the three major grammatical features that shape the Modern 
Greek noun system. Number (here as singular vs. plural) is a very common inflectional feature 
for many languages, not only Indo-European ones, so we have few things to say. Gender and 
case are less common, so it is worth mentioning a few things about them.
2.1.1 Gender
If you are familiar with gender languages such as German, French, Russian, Italian or Spanish, 
then you have some idea about what gender is. For those who are not, I will try to explain gen-
der using an analogy from real life: Humans and animals can be assigned a sex (a man or a bull 
are males, a woman or a cow are females), things cannot (tables and chairs are “neuter” in this 
respect). Likewise nouns must be either masculine, or feminine, or, finally, neuter (which origi-
nally meant “neither masculine, nor feminine”). This three-fold distinction of gender (compare 

--- Page 31 ---

Chapter 2 | Nouns and Verbs
Page 22
to the two-fold distinction of gender in Spanish, Italian or French) is the basis for the division 
of Modern Greek nouns in three major gender categories. Any Modern Greek noun must be 
either masculine, or feminine, or neuter. All nouns can have one and only gender, I mean they 
cannot be feminine here and masculine there. And absolutely no noun can be gender-free. 
As part of grammatical information, gender is assigned to the right part of the noun:
(2) δρόμος (MASC.)  ώρα (FEM.)  βιβλίο (NEUT.)
 “street”   “hour”   “book”
Gender is also manifested outside the noun itself, in words like the definite article (a word 
equivalent of the English the):
(3) ο δρόμος (MASC.)  η ώρα (FEM.)  το βιβλίο (NEUT.)
Having these in mind, let’s make a table about the gender groups of basic Modern Greek nouns:
MASCULINE FEMININE NEUTER
ο δρόμος (“street”) το βιβλίο (“book”)
ο άντρας (“man”) η ώρα (“hour”) το παιδί (“child”)
ο χάρτης (“map”) η ζώνη (“belt”) το πράγμα (“thing”)
Table 2.1: Gender Groups of Basic Modern Greek Nouns.
Nouns of the same gender share the same definite article, but not the same endings. It would be 
reasonable then to use this short word as a safe way to recognize a noun’s gender. This is what 
most dictionaries do, and this is what I am going to do from now on.
Dictionaries give information not only about a noun’s meaning but also about its gender. 
Some of them use abbreviations such as αρσ. (αρσενικό, “masculine”), θηλ. (θηλυκό, “fem-
inine”), and ουδ. (ουδέτερο, “neuter”). Others register each noun along with the appropri-
ate definite article (o for masculine, η for feminine, το for neuter), usually following the 
noun (inside parentheses, or separated by a comma). Keep in mind that the definite article 
in Modern Greek always precedes the noun, never follows it. Dictionaries simply choose 
the final position for the article in order to make alphabetical classification easier. For ex-
ample: δρόμος, ο / δρόμος (ο) (press here to see the real entry: http://www.greek-language.
gr/greekLang/modern_greek/tools/lexica/triantafyllides/search.html.
Is gender predictable in Modern Greek? The answer is “no”. For Modern Greek, as for many 

--- Page 32 ---

Chapter 2 | Nouns and Verbs
Page 23
Indo-European languages, gender lies far from the idea of “natural” sex I used before just to 
explain what gender looks like. A chair in real life is definitely a neuter, but the word καρέκλα 
is not (it’s a feminine). Coffee, chocolate and tea might be related as non-alcoholic, usually hot 
drinks, but gender seems to disagree with our concept and treats them differently.  
(4) ο καφές  η σοκολάτα  το τσάι
 “coffee”  “chocolate”  “tea”
Personally, I see no reason why coffee is registered as masculine in Modern Greek, chocolate 
as feminine and tea as neuter. Equally I see no reason why a pencil, a marker and a quill pen do 
not share the same gender (which is which? Ask yourselves first and then check here: “pencil” 
is το μολύβι, “marker” is ο μαρκαδόρος, “quill pen” is η πένα. 
There are some fields, though, where reason might help. Nouns typically associated with 
humans and animals are generally affected by sex. Males are usually masculine, while 
females are usually feminine:
(I) ο άντρας (“man”)  η γυναίκα (“woman”)
 ο Πέτρος (“Peter”)  η Κατερίνα (“Catherine”) 
 ο ταύρος (“bull”)  η αγελάδα (“cow”)
The same holds for professions as a property of humans: 
(II) ο δάσκαλος (“male teacher”) η δασκάλα (“female teacher”)
 ο γιατρός (“male doctor”)  η γιατρός (“female doctor”)
There are also some regularities in gender that should not be ignored. For example, most 
countries are feminine, simply because the word “country” in Modern Greek is feminine 
(η χώρα). 
(III) η Αγγλία (“UK”), η Γαλλία (“France”), η Ισπανία (“Spain”) 
But even inside this group there are considerable exceptions:
(IV) ο Καναδάς (“Canada”), ο Λίβανος (“Lebanon”), 
 το Μεξικό (“Mexico”), το Ιράκ (“Irac”)

--- Page 33 ---

Chapter 2 | Nouns and Verbs
Page 24
Loanwords (words borrowed from other languages) are not uncommon in Modern Greek. 
When a loan noun becomes part of the Modern Greek vocabulary, it must definitely get a 
gender. Which one? The noun πίτσα (did you recognize pizza?) looks like a feminine be-
cause of its ending -α (compare to the noun ώρα of Table 2.1 on page 22). Therefore it 
is classified as a feminine (η πίτσα). Countries like Λίβανος or Μεξικό have gone through 
a similar classification project (the former looks like a masculine, the latter like a neuter).
But what about the following nouns?
(V) φεστιβάλ (“festival”), κομπιούτερ (“computer”), 
 γκαράζ (“garage”), Ιράκ (“Iraq”), ευρώ (“euro”)
The endings of these nouns do not match any of the three gender groups of Table 2.1. 
Therefore the nouns cannot be classified as masculine, feminine, or neuter. This kind of 
words all fall under the category of neuter, perhaps because the neuter is constructed on a 
“neither-nor” basis.
Cars
Gender draws an interesting distinction among cars. 
• Everyday, average cars are usually neuter:
(VI) το Φίατ (“Fiat”), το Πεζό (“Peugeot”), το Σμαρτ (“Smart”)
• Luxury cars on the other side are usually feminine:
(VII) η Μερσεντές (“Mercedes”), η Φεράρι (“Ferrari”)
Why? Here is a possible answer: Expensive cars are usually beloved items (not tools, like 
ordinary cars), so people tend to humanize them. But then, why would a Ferrari become 
a “she” and not a “he”? The explanation goes beyond the scope of this grammar, so I will 
skip it, to focus on gender again.
If gender is unpredictable, then reason cannot help you with it. The safest way to handle gen -
der is to use your memory and learn a noun’s gender along with its meaning (don’t leave it 
for later, you’ll get lost). And if those familiar with another gender language are looking for 
analogies to get some help, they should abandon the idea. A chair is feminine in Modern Greek 
(η καρέκλα), Spanish (la silla) and French (la chaise), but masculine in German (der Stuhl). I 
know that sometimes it can be frustrating, but there it is. If you need some motivation, keep in 
mind that the gender of nouns affects words that depend on them, such as adjectives, pronouns 
and numerals (see Chapters 5 on page 66 and 6 on page 82).

--- Page 34 ---

Chapter 2 | Nouns and Verbs
Page 25
Considering that nouns of the same gender share the same endings (masculines for ex-
ample all end in -ς, realized as -ος, -ας, -ης), one might conclude that guessing a noun’s 
gender from its ending is possible. This way may seem much easier than memorizing 
each noun’s gender (and in fact many teaching books are based on it), but it is not always 
efficient. As you will find out if you go on with Modern Greek, there are many words that 
share the same ending but not the same gender:
(VIII) o δρόμος (“street”), η έξοδος (“exit”), το κράτος (“state”)
2.1.2 Case
If you are familiar with case languages (like Russian, Turkish, Arabic or German), then you 
know what case is. For those who are not, I shall try to explain the basics of case using an el -
ementary scenario. Imagine two Greek male students, Γιάννης and Πέτρος, who live together. 
This situation could be described by the following sentences:
(5a) O Γιάννης μένει με τον Πέτρο.
 “ John lives with Peter.”
(5b) O Πέτρος μένει με τον Γιάννη.
 “ Peter lives with John.”
(5c) O Γιάννης και ο Πέτρος μένουν μαζί. 
 “ John and Peter live together.”
Μένει / μένουν are “lives” / “(they) live”, με is “with”, και is the Modern Greek “and”. John and 
Peter of the above sentences are present in two different forms:
(6) “John”  “Peter”
 ο Γιάννης  ο Πέτρος
 τον Γιάννη  τον Πέτρο
The use of these forms is not random. I mean you are not free to replace one form with another. 
Why? The answer lies in syntax: Each one of these forms seems to hold a different role inside 
the sentence. Let’s take the forms τον Γιάννη / τον Πέτρο. These forms are used only after a 
preposition (με in this case). Modern Greek nouns then may vary according to their (syntactic) 
role, and this sort of variation is reflected in their case. 
The above examples do not exhaust case in Modern Greek, which will be examined in the fol-
lowing chapter. What you should keep in mind for the moment is that nouns may vary accord-

--- Page 35 ---

Chapter 2 | Nouns and Verbs
Page 26
ing to their syntactic role. And, if this variation sounds “exotic” for your linguistic standards, 
check the following example: 
(7a) He lives here.
(7b) Peter lives with him. 
This is an instance of case in English: He and him are two forms of the same personal pronoun 
(third person, masculine), and their use depends on syntax in a way similar to our examples.  
2.2 The Grammar of Verbs
Modern Greek verbs seem to share the same internal structure as nouns:
(8) παίζω   παίζεις
 “I play”  “you play”
These forms share an identical left part (the stem), namely παίζ-, that bears the (lexical) mean-
ing of the verb (“play”, in our example). The right part (the ending) is variable and bears gram-
matical information. In the case of παίζεις the ending - εις indicates, among other things, that 
the verb is in the second person singular. 
Modern Greek verbs carry grammatical information not only about person and number, but 
also about tense, aspect, mood and voice. This sort of information is basically located in the 
ending of the verb, but may also be found in the middle of it, even in front of it, either as part of 
the verb itself or as a separate word (compare with the article in front of nouns). Thus, there is 
a lot to be said about the grammar of verbs, and this is what I am going to do in the following 
units. 
2.2.1 Person, Number, and an Optional Subject 
I believe you are all familiar with the notions of person and number, so I will skip the expla -
nation. What you must keep in mind in the case of Modern Greek, is that person (first, second 
and third) and number (singular vs. plural) are clearly manifested in the ending of the verb. 
This fact allows for an optional (not obligatory) subject in Modern Greek. Compare again some 
forms of the Modern Greek verb παίζω (“to play”) with the English verb to play. 
(9) παίζω   παίζουμε
 “I play”  “we play”
Checking παίζω or παίζουμε I can “read” person and number inside the verb itself (consider 
play, which gives no such information). Therefore I do not need a subject-pronoun like “I” or 
“We” to tell me about person and number. So, if I had to say “I play basketball” or “We play 

--- Page 36 ---

Chapter 2 | Nouns and Verbs
Page 27
basketball”, I would skip “I” or “We” and go like this (the hyphen indicates the missing sub -
ject-pronoun in the Modern Greek sentences):
(10a) (-) παίζω μπάσκετ.
 “ I play basketball.”
(10b) (-) παίζουμε μπάσκετ.
 “ We play basketball.”
But what about the following sentences?
(11a) ΕΓΩ παίζω μπάσκετ.
 “ It’s me who plays basketball.”
(11b) O ΠΕΤΡΟΣ παίζει μπάσκετ.
 “ It is Peter who plays basketball.”
The English translation shows clearly that here we have a focus (contrastive) reading (check 
Unit 1.7.3 on page 17): It is Peter ( not Catherine, for example) who plays basketball. And in 
this context the subject (either as a pronoun or as a noun) becomes necessary. 
The focus sentences of 11a-11b are just an instance of contrast. Compare the following sen -
tences:
(12a) Είμαστε στο σχολείο. (-) παίζουμε μπάσκετ.
 “We are at school. We are playing basketball.”
(12b) Είμαστε στο σχολείο. Εγώ παίζω βόλεϊ. Η Μαρία παίζει μπάσκετ.
 “We are at school. Ι am playing volleyball. Maria is playing basketball.”
The verb παίζουμε in 12a does not need a subject, because its subject is clearly identical to the 
subject of the first sentence. The verbs παίζω and παίζει in 12b do need a subject because the 
subjects now are not identical to the subject of the first sentence. I believe you all see some 
sort of contrast between subjects, which brings sentence 12b close to focus sentences such as 
11a-11b. 

--- Page 37 ---

Chapter 2 | Nouns and Verbs
Page 28
Verbs must share the same person and number with their subject, either present or missing 
(but still presumed). 
(IX) (Εγώ) παίζω.
 (Εμείς) παίζουμε.
This is an instance of agreement (for other instances, check Chapter 5 on page 66).
At the moment nobody expects you to handle optional subject perfectly (unless you come from 
a subject-optional language like Spanish or Italian). The point of the unit is to develop your 
subject-optional awareness, and this is it. Remember that people will be delighted to hear you 
speak Modern Greek, and they will definitely not mind a pleonastic use of the subject. 
Verbs are entered in dictionaries according to the first person singular of the present tense. 
So don’t look for “to be” or “to have” but rather for “I am”, “I have”. So the Modern Greek 
verb “to play” will be registered as παίζω. For a real entry press here: http://www.greeklan-
guage.gr/greekLang/modern_greek/tools/lexica/triantafyllides/search.html.
2.2.2 Tense and Aspect
Verbs basically describe events or states (in order to save time and space, I will use the term 
“action” instead). Actions may have a time reference like in the following sentences: 
(13a) Παίζουμε μπάσκετ.
 “We play basketball.”
(13b) Παίξαμε μπάσκετ.
 “We played basketball.”
(13c) Θα παίξουμε μπάσκετ.
 “We will play basketball.”
Playing basketball may be a present (like in 13a), a past (like in 13b), or a future action (like in 
13c). This is roughly what tense is about.
Notice that the present here basically coincides with the moment of speaking. So a past 
action is an action that happened before the moment of speaking. Accordingly, a future 
action is an action that will happen after the moment of speaking.

--- Page 38 ---

Chapter 2 | Nouns and Verbs
Page 29
Τense in Modern Greek is marked by the endings of the verbs but also by independent words 
which precede the verb, like in the future tense (compare to the English will/shall):
(14) παίξαμε  θα παίξουμε 
 “we played”  “we will play”
Perhaps you have already noticed that the stem of the verb is not the same everywhere. In order 
to explain this fact, I will have to introduce aspect. Check the following sentences:
(15a) Παίξαμε μπάσκετ.
 “We played basketball.”
(15b) Παίζαμε μπάσκετ.
 “We were playing basketball.”
Both sentences describe a past action. The first sentence describes it as a perfect (completed) 
action. The second sentence describes the same action, but this time as an imperfect (in this 
case ongoing) action. The different ways to view an action represent aspect. 
Aspect in Modern Greek is clearly related to the stem of the verb, and not to its endings. The 
verbs in the above sentences share exactly the same endings, so, obviously, the difference in as-
pect is marked by the difference in stems (παίξ- vs. παίζ-).  The first one, called perfective stem, 
combines here with endings of the past to form the Modern Greek simple past. The second one, 
called imperfective stem, combines here with endings of the past to create the Modern Greek 
past continuous. Aspect and tense then work together to produce the actual tenses of Modern 
Greek, in this case past simple and past continuous: 
(16) παίξ-αμε  PERFECTIVE-PAST → PAST SIMPLE
 παίζ-αμε  IMPERFECTIVE-PAST → PAST CONTINUOUS
I won’t go into further details, so I will conclude this discussion here. What I want you to re -
member is this: These stems (perfective and imperfective) are basic for any possible form of 
any Modern Greek verb. To put it simply: As long as you know these stems (along with the 
appropriate endings), the Modern Greek verbal system will be really easy to handle. 

--- Page 39 ---

Chapter 2 | Nouns and Verbs
Page 30
How to learn these stems? It is very simple. The imperfective stem comes along with every 
new verb you learn, since it is the basis for the present tense. The perfective stem is the 
basis for other tenses such as the past and future simples, so you learn it when you learn 
either one of these tenses. In this book, information about the imperfective and perfective 
stems can be found in Chapters 4, 8, 9 and in the Appendix.
2.2.3 Modality and Mood
Let’s see the following sentences:
(17a) Παίζω μπάσκετ.
 “Ι play basketball.”
(17b) Μπορώ να παίξω μπάσκετ.
 “I am able to / I can play basketball.”
(17c) Πρέπει να παίξω μπάσκετ.
 “I have (I must/I should/I ought…) to play basketball.” 
(17d) Μπορεί να παίξω μπάσκετ. 
 “Ι might play basketball.”
All of the above sentences involve the same action: playing basketball. But there are consid -
erable differences in the way the action is perceived. In the first sentence playing basketball is 
considered a fact. In the other three sentences playing basketball is considered not a fact but 
rather an ability, an obligation or a possibility. These are instances of modality.
Modality is the basis for mood distinctions in the Modern Greek verbal system: the in -
dicative (παίζω) is the mood that refers to facts, while the subjunctive ( να παίξω) refers to 
non-facts, such as abilities, obligations or possibilities. There are other moods which will be 
introduced later. For the moment keep in mind that subjunctive (which is roughly equivalent 
to the English infinitive) is as important as the indicative for communication and therefore a 
necessary part of levels A1-A2 (see Chapter 9).
2.2.4 Voice
Statements like Ι go home  or I am coming from school  are essential for everyday communi -
cation. Accordingly verbs meaning “to go” or “to come” are basic in language learning, and 
usually they can be found in the first chapters of any relevant teaching method. Here are the 
Modern Greek versions of these verbs:

--- Page 40 ---

Chapter 2 | Nouns and Verbs
Page 31
(18) πάω (“to go”) / έρχομαι (“to come”)
Τhese verbs represent voice distinctions in Modern Greek. Like gender divides nouns, so voice 
divides verbs into two major inflectional groups. Πάω represents the “active” voice. Έρχομαι 
represents the “passive” (or “medio-passive”) voice. Every Modern Greek verb must fall on 
either one of the two categories according to its ending in the first person singular of the present 
tense (as a dictionary entry, in other words). 
Grammar terminology might be misleading at this point (I guess you all had to go through 
exercises on the passive voice in English), so I must make the following point: The term “voice” 
as used in this context is related to form, not meaning. The verb έρχομαι is a “passive” verb be-
cause of its ending, not because of its meaning (personally, I see nothing “passive” in a motion 
verb). And the same holds for other verbs of this category like the following: 
(19) είμαι (“to be”) / θυμάμαι (“to remember”)
Υour main concern at levels A1-A2 will be “active”, not “passive” verbs. Nevertheless you 
cannot avoid basic “passive” verbs like είμαι, έρχομαι, θυμάμαι. Considering “passive” verbs, 
keep in mind the following:
• “Active” and “passive” verbs are structured along the same grammatical features. Like 
“active” verbs, “passive” verbs also contain information about person, number and the 
rest. Like “active” verbs again, “passive” verbs are structured along an imperfective and a 
perfective stem. So what was said in Units 2.2.1 on page 26 -2.2.3 on page 30 holds 
for the “passive” voice as well. 
• The endings of the two groups seem to be totally different, but in fact they are not. As 
you will find out by the end of levels A1-A2, the Modern Greek verbal system is based on 
economy: It “recycles” endings, changing other parts of the verb (such as the stem, check 
15a-15b on page 29) in order to produce a great variety of forms. Therefore the Modern 
Greek verbal system is a field which addresses reason rather than memory. As long as you 
understand some basic rules and memorize a few models, you will be able to do things 
properly.

Street Food
Street food is here to remind us of gender distinctions in Modern Greek: A masculine          
(ο γύρος), a feminine (η τυρόπιτα) and a neuter (το κουλούρι) represent the basic trio of 
Modern Greek street food.
Κουλούρι and τυρόπιτα stand for a late breakfast (most Greeks have only coffee in the 
morning and then they eat something around 11 a.m.). Κουλούρι, a ring made of bread 
dough with sesame sprinkled on top (it looks somewhat like the New York bagel), is sold 
at stands οn the street or in bakeries. Τυρόπιτα is the most famous instance of a series of 
πίτα, which is basically a baked sandwich of flat pastry dough or strudel leaves and various 
fillings that give every πίτα its name (for example, σπανακόπιτα is a pie filled with spin-
ach). All sorts of πίτα are sold in bakeries or specialized shops (the name is τυροπιτάδικο, 
because τυρόπιτα is the queen of such pies).
Unlike κουλούρι and τυρόπιτα, γύρος is preferred for lunch or dinner. Γύρος basically 
consists of  slivers of roasted meat cut from a huge meat loaf on a vertical spit that goes 
around next to the fire (γύρος derives from γυρίζω, a verb meaning “to go round”, “to 
turn”). Γύρος is served in a πίτα (here flat bread dough) usually with tomato, sliced onion 
and τζατζίκι (a thick sauce made of Greek yoghurt, cucumber, vinegar, olive oil, and lots 
of garlic). Γύρος is sold in specialized shops (the most common word for such shops is 
σουβλατζίδικο). 
Whatever your taste in street food is, keep in mind the following: Τυρόπιτα and κουλούρι 
are  morning food, γύρος is afternoon and evening food. You are perfectly entitled to have 
a κουλούρι in the afternoon and a γύρος in the morning, but they will not be as fresh and 
delicious as they are when the time is right.
SUMMARY

side them, basically as part of their endings. Chapter 2 introduces main grammatical features 
of nouns and verbs, such as gender and case (for nouns), or tense and aspect (for verbs).

CHAPTER 3 | More about Nouns: Nominative and Accusative Cases
In the previous chapter I introduced case as part of the grammar of nouns and promised (but 
some promises might sound like threats) to come back to this issue later. “Later” is now, so 
let’s start! 
The Modern Greek case system consists of four cases. All of them are important, but two are 
crucial for basic communication. Let me then introduce them using an example from Unit 
2.1.2:
(1a) Ο Γιάννης μένει με τον Πέτρο.
 “ John lives with Peter.”
(1b) Ο Πέτρος μένει με τον Γιάννη.
 “ Peter lives with John.”
(1c) Ο Γιάννης και ο Πέτρος μένουν μαζί. 
 “ John and Peter live together.” 
The forms ο Πέτρος / ο Γιάννης are instances of the nominative case. The forms τον Πέτρο / 
τον Γιάννη are instances of the accusative case. Each case seems to be governed by several 
regularities:
• In use. The accusative holds a specific syntactic role in those sentences: It is used after a 
preposition like με (technically Ι would say it is part of a prepositional phrase). The nomi -
native holds another syntactic role, which will be explained below. 
• In form. The forms of the nominative o Γιάννης / ο Πέτρος seem to differ in exactly the 
same way from the forms of the accusative τον Γιάννη / τον Πέτρο (check the article and 
the ending).
There is then a lot to be said about both issues. For practical reasons, I shall first deal with mat-
ters of form, to come back later to matters of use.
3.1 Case as Form
The nouns we used before for our “living together” scenario were masculine nouns. And mas-
culine nouns seem to share a similar pattern regarding case. The nominative and the accusative 
are related to a different form of the article as well as different endings: 

--- Page 45 ---

Chapter 3 | More about Nouns: Nominative and Accusative Cases
Page 36
(2) o Πέτρος / ο Γιάννης   (NOMINATIVE)
 τον Πέτρο / τον Γιάννη  (ACCUSATIVE)
Let’s now work with a similar scenario. This time two Greek female students, Ελένη and 
Κατερίνα, share the same apartment. This situation can again be described by the following 
sentences:
(3a) H Ελένη μένει με την Κατερίνα.
 “ Helen lives with Catherine.”
(3b) H Κατερίνα μένει με την Ελένη.
 “ Catherine lives with Helen.”
(3c) Η Ελένη και η Κατερίνα μένουν μαζί.
 “ Helen and Catherine live together.”
Like masculine nouns, feminine nouns seem to share a similar pattern regarding case. But this 
time the pattern is different. Nominative and accusative are related to a different form of the 
article again, but now the endings remain the same:
(4) η Ελένη / η Κατερίνα  (NOMINATIVE)
 την Ελένη / την Κατερίνα  (ACCUSATIVE)
I believe it is clear by now that nouns follow different patterns according to their gender. It 
would then be reasonable to start from gender distinctions (see Table 2.1 on page 22) in order 
to introduce case as form, and this is what most grammars do:
NOMINATIVE ACCUSATIVE
MASCULINE ο δρόμος τον δρόμο
ο άντρας τον άντρα
ο χάρτης τον χάρτη
FEMININE η ώρα την ώρα
η ζώνη την ζώνη
NEUTER το βιβλίο το βιβλίο
το παιδί το παιδί
το πράγμα το πράγμα
Table 3.1: Nominative and Accusative (Singular) for Basic Modern Greek Nouns.

--- Page 46 ---

Chapter 3 | More about Nouns: Nominative and Accusative Cases
Page 37
Following dictionaries, I shall consider the nominative to be the “initial” case, which under -
goes a number of changes in order to “produce” the accusative. In this respect:
• Masculine nouns undergo two changes: one in the definite article (o → τον), another one in 
the ending (the final -ς is removed).
• Feminine nouns undergo only one change, in the definite article (η → την).
• Neuter nouns undergo no change at all.
Gender groups, then, are structured along a scale of complexity regarding case. In this scale 
masculine nouns represent the top, and neuter nouns represent the bottom. 
CHANGES DIFFERENCE
MASCULINE NOUNS 2 Major
FEMININE NOUNS 1 Medium
NEUTER NOUNS 0 None/Zero
Table 3.2: Modern Greek Nouns on a Scale of Inflectional Complexity.
Nouns are entered in dictionaries by the nominative, not the accusative, case. So, don’t 
look for δρόμο, άντρα, χάρτη, but for δρόμος, άντρας, χάρτης. For real entries press here: 
http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/modern_greek/tools/lexica/triantafyllides/.
When speaking, people usually drop the final -ν of the definite article in the accusative 
before some sounds (so you might hear τον άντρα, την ώρα, but το χάρτη, τη ζώνη), and 
sometimes this is reflected on writing. In my opinion you already have enough to worry 
about, so I kept the same form everywhere. Keep in mind, though, that there are books 
about levels A1-A2 that follow this difference. For details press here: http://en.wikipedia.
org/wiki/Modern_Greek_phonology (see Unit Sandhi).
3.2 Case in Use
The nominative and the accusative hold specific syntactic roles within the sentence. In this 
unit Ι shall examine these roles introducing five basic syntactic “contexts” as instances of the 
use of these cases. I know that by the end of the unit you will be exhausted, so there is a short 
summary there to help you survive and go on.

--- Page 47 ---

Chapter 3 | More about Nouns: Nominative and Accusative Cases
Page 38
3.2.1 Subject, Object, and Free Word Order 
Let’s see the following sentence:
(5) O Πέτρος αγαπάει την Μαρία.
 “ Peter loves Mary.”
Peter is the subject of the verb, the one who loves Mary. Mary is the object of the verb, the one 
who is loved by Peter. What if Mary loves Peter? 
(6) H Μαρία αγαπάει τον Πέτρο.
 “ Mary loves Peter.”
Mary is now the subject, the one who loves Peter. Peter now is the object, the one who is loved 
by Mary. I believe it is clear that the nominative holds the role of the subject, and the accusative 
holds the role of the object.
What about the following sentence? (Think before you read the answer.)
(7) Tον Πέτρο αγαπάει η Μαρία.
This sentence means again “Mary loves Peter”, and not “Peter loves Mary”. Why? Because η 
Μαρία is clearly in the nominative, and the nominative is the subject regardless of its position. 
Equally τον Πέτρο is in the accusative, therefore it is the object no matter where it is. In other 
words: Syntactic roles like subject and object are clear inside a Modern Greek noun, so posi -
tion within the sentence becomes irrelevant. Compare now to English: Nouns carry no such 
information inside them, therefore position is what counts. So if I change the position of the 
nouns in a sentence like Mary loves Peter, what I will get is a totally different sentence (Peter 
loves Mary).
Subjects and objects may in fact occupy various positions inside the sentence:
(8a) Η Μαρία αγαπάει τον Πέτρο.
(8b) Τον Πέτρο η Μαρία αγαπάει.
(8c) Η Μαρία τον Πέτρο αγαπάει.
(8d) Αγαπάει τον Πέτρο η Μαρία.
(8e) Αγαπάει η Μαρία τον Πέτρο.
All of the above sentences are real. And all of them mean the same (“Mary loves Peter”). What 
you should keep from this discussion is the following:

--- Page 48 ---

Chapter 3 | More about Nouns: Nominative and Accusative Cases
Page 39
• Subject and object may take different positions inside the sentence. These different po -
sitions do no affect the basic meaning of the sentence, but they are related to focus and 
accordingly they combine with different emphatic readings (see Unit 1.7.3 on page 17).
• Examples 8a-e represent free word order in Modern Greek. But free word order in this case 
has its limits. You can reverse the order S-V-O (Subject-Verb-Object) in Modern Greek and 
make S-O-V , V-S-O etc. But you cannot reverse the words inside the subject unit itself and 
put the noun first and the article second. 
• Nobody expects you at the moment to master free word order. This will come with time 
and practice. But at least you must have some sort of free-word-order awareness, in order 
to understand natives when they do it. For the moment you can use the S-V-O order, or, if 
you feel adventurous, the V-S-O order, which is very common in Modern Greek.
The terms “subject” and “object” go much beyond the type of sentences we have examined 
so far. A subject does not need to be the “doer” of an action directed at the object:
(Ia) O Πέτρος κοιμάται.
 “ Peter is sleeping.”
(Ib) O Πέτρος νομίζει ότι κάνω λάθος.
 “ Peter thinks I am wrong.” 
(Ic) O Πέτρος είναι γιατρός.
 “ Peter is a doctor.”
3.2.2 Predication
Let’s see the following sentences:
(9a) O Πέτρος θέλει γιατρό.
 “ Peter needs a doctor.”
(9b) Ο Πέτρος είναι γιατρός.
 “ Peter is a doctor.”
Sentence 9a clearly involves two persons, Peter and the doctor. Peter is the subject and the doc-
tor is the object. Unlike sentence 9a, sentence 9b involves only one person, Peter. What about 
the doctor? The doctor of 9b is not another person, it’s Peter’s profession. Technically, the word 
γιατρός of 9b is not an object but a predicate to the subject. It gives extra information about the 
subject. In this sense doctor works like an adjective, and Modern Greek adjectives must follow 
the case of the noun they modify (this is the technical term for such relations). This is why we 
have the nominative (γιατρός) in sentence 9b.

--- Page 49 ---

Chapter 3 | More about Nouns: Nominative and Accusative Cases
Page 40
Note that a predicate may modify not only the subject but also the object. In that case, it will 
be in the accusative:
(10) Τα παιδιά έκαναν τον Πέτρο ήρωα.  (NOM. ο ήρωας)
 “The children made Peter a hero.”
3.2.3 Apposition
Let’s start from the following sentences:
(11a) Ο φίλος της, ο Πέτρος, είναι από τον Καναδά.
 “ Her boyfriend, Peter, is from Canada.”
(11b) Ξέρεις τον φίλο της, τον Πέτρο;
 “Do you know her boyfriend, Peter?”
Peter of sentences 11a and 11b is not a person other than the boyfriend. Basically it is a piece 
of extra information about the boyfriend. As the doctor in sentence 9b, Peter here works like 
an adjective modifying another noun. And, again as the doctor of 9b, it follows the case of the 
noun it modifies. This is why it may be in the nominative (11a) or the accusative (11b). 
Let’s now turn to less obvious cases of apposition and examine content relations. These rela -
tions typically involve a container and its content.
(12) Θέλω ένα ποτήρι νερό.
 “I need a glass of water.”
Like English, in Modern Greek the container comes first and content comes second. Unlike 
English, there is no intermediate word to connect the two terms. 
What about case in this structure? Let’s see the following sentences:
(13a) Θέλω ένα ποτήρι χυμό.  (NOM. ο χυμός)
 “I need a glass of juice.”
(13b) Ένα ποτήρι χυμός κάνει πάντα καλό. 
 “Α glass of juice always helps.”
Sentences 13a and 13b show that content follows the case of the container. In 13a the noun ο 
χυμός is in the accusative because the container is in the accusative (as the object). In sentence 
13b, the content again follows the case of the container (now it’s nominative, because the con-

--- Page 50 ---

Chapter 3 | More about Nouns: Nominative and Accusative Cases
Page 41
tainer is in the nominative, as the subject). 
Notice that the above pattern in Modern Greek extends from “literal” content relations to 
abstract appositive relations like the following. The container is now a measure holding a 
specific quantity of the content:
(IIa) ένα κιλό φέτα
 “a kilo of feta cheese”
(IIb) ένα λίτρο γάλα 
 “a liter of milk”
Notice also that the above pattern is the basis for hundreds of everyday phrases like the 
following: 
(IIIa) χυμός πορτοκάλι
 “orange juice”
(IIIb) παγωτό σοκολάτα
 “chocolate ice cream”
(IIIc) ζελέ φράουλα
 “strawberry jelly” 
Phrases like these are based on simple reasoning: Like there is coffee in my cup, so there 
is orange in my juice and chocolate in my ice cream.
3.2.4 Prepositional Phrases
In the previous units, the nominative and the accusative held contrastive (subject vs. object) or 
complementary roles (as in predication and apposition). From now on, the  nominative aban -
dons the picture, leaving the accusative alone. Nouns preceded by a preposition (basically με, 
σε, για, από) are parts of a prepositional phrase. And as parts of a prepositional phrase, these 
nouns are always in the accusative case:
(14a) O Γιάννης μένει με τον Πέτρο.
 “John lives with Peter.”
(14b) Tο βιβλίο είναι για τον Πέτρο.
 “The book is for Peter.”
(14c) Eίμαι από την Ιταλία.
 “I am from Italy.”

--- Page 51 ---

Chapter 3 | More about Nouns: Nominative and Accusative Cases
Page 42
(14d) Mένω στην Ελλάδα.
 “I live in Greece.”
The use of the accusative in prepositional phrases is really easy to handle and has already been 
examined (see Unit 2.1.2 on page 25), so there are few things to be said here. Keep in mind 
that as part of a prepositional phrase, the accusative may be either the (indirect) object of the 
verb (like in 15a) or an adverbial (like in 15b):
(15a) Δίνω ένα βιβλίο στον Πέτρο.
 “I give a book to Peter.”
(15b) Eίμαι στο σχολείο.
 “I am at school.”
3.2.5 Time
The expression of time in Modern Greek often requires not a prepositional phrase or an adverb, 
but a single accusative: 
(16) Φεύγω την Παρασκευή.
 “I am leaving on Friday.”
The single accusative is typical for days, periods of the day, months, seasons, and holidays (for 
the relevant vocabulary press here: http://quizlet.com/1975167/modern-greek-days-months-
seasons-flash-cards/):
(17a) Έρχομαι την Πέμπτη. 
 “I am coming on Thursday.”
(17b) Πίνω καφέ το πρωί.
 “I have coffee in the morning.”
(17c) Τα γενέθλιά μου είναι τον Οκτώβριο.
 “Μy birthday is in October.”
(17d) Τα σχολεία είναι κλειστά το καλοκαίρι.
 “Schools are closed in the summer.”
(17e) Πάντα κάνουμε πάρτι τα Χριστούγεννα.
 “We always have a party at Christmas.”

--- Page 52 ---

Chapter 3 | More about Nouns: Nominative and Accusative Cases
Page 43
The only exception is “clock time”, where you need a prepositional phrase instead:
(18) Έχω ραντεβού στις πέντε. 
 “I have an appointment at five.”
The single accusative also expresses time seen as quantity or frequency:
(19a) Περιμένω πέντε λεπτά.
 “I’ve been waiting for five minutes.”
(19b) Πάω στην Κρήτη κάθε χρόνο.
 “I go to Crete every year.”
Words typically associated with time do not need to be used only as adverbials. They may 
hold other syntactic roles within the sentence, and consequently they may take another 
case. Let’s take Τρίτη (“Tuesday”) as an example:
(IVa) Φεύγω την Τρίτη.    (ADVERBIAL: SINGLE ACCUSATIVE)
 “I am leaving on Tuesday.”
(IVb) Η Τρίτη είναι μετά την Δευτέρα.  (SUBJECT: NOMINATIVE)
 “ Tuesday comes after Monday.”
(IVc) Σήμερα είναι Τρίτη.    (PREDICATE: NOMINATIVE)
 “It’s Tuesday today.”
(IVd) Προτιμώ την Τρίτη.   (OBJECT: ACCUSATIVE)
 “I prefer Tuesday.”
Notice that in IVd the noun Τρίτη is in the accusative again, but for different reasons. Now 
it is the object, not an adverbial. 
For similar reasons, two questions like the following have different answers (check your 
own language):
(Va) A: Τι μέρα είναι σήμερα;   B: Τρίτη.
 A: “What day is it today?”  B:“Tuesday.”
(Vb) A: Πότε / Τι μέρα έχεις τεστ;    B: Την Τρίτη.
 A: “When / Which day do you have a test?” B: “On Tuesday.”
3.2.6 Synopsis
Case is strongly related to syntax: The nominative and the accusative represent the major com-
plements of the verb, the subject and the object respectively. They are also related to any noun 

--- Page 53 ---

Chapter 3 | More about Nouns: Nominative and Accusative Cases
Page 44
that modifies the subject and the object, either by predication or by apposition. The accusative 
is also used inside prepositional phrases, either as the (indirect) object of the verb or as an ad -
verbial. Finally, the single accusative can work as an adverbial, expressing time.
NOMINATIVE ACCUSATIVE
1. Subject 1. Object (single accusative)
- 2. Object (indirect) / Adverbial (prepositional accusative)
- 3. Time adverbial (single accusative)
Table 3.3: A Synopsis of the Use of the Nominative and the Accusative.
3.3 Back to Form: The Plural
The plural in Modern Greek is simply an ordinary plural. Therefore there is nothing to be said 
about its use. All you need to know concerns its form. The following table will help you with 
it (the singular in parentheses is here only to help):
(SINGULAR) PLURAL
(NOMINATIVE) (ACCUSATIVE) NOMINATIVE ACCUSATIVE
MASCULINE (o δρόμος) (τον δρόμο) οι δρόμοι τους δρόμους
(ο άντρας) (τον άντρα) οι άντρες τους άντρες
(ο χάρτης) (τον χάρτη) οι χάρτες τους χάρτες
FEMININE (η ώρα) (την ώρα) οι ώρες τις ώρες
(η ζώνη) (την ζώνη) οι ζώνες τις ζώνες
NEUTER (το βιβλίο) (το βιβλίο) τα βιβλία τα βιβλία
(το παιδί) (το παιδί) τα παιδιά τα παιδιά
(το πράγμα) (το πράγμα) τα πράγματα τα πράγματα
Table 3.4: Nominative and Accusative (Plural) for Basic Modern Greek Nouns.
A few remarks about the plural now:
• Grammars usually deem the singular, and among all cases the nominative, to be the starting 
point for the plural. In this respect nouns in the singular must undergo changes in order to 
become plural. These changes have to do with the definite article and the endings of the 
nouns:
(20) o δρόμος  →  οι δρόμοι
 τον δρόμο  →  τους δρόμους

--- Page 54 ---

Chapter 3 | More about Nouns: Nominative and Accusative Cases
Page 45
Loanwords have an ordinary plural if their ending resembles the endings of Modern Greek 
nouns. So η πίτσα is inflected like η ώρα (see Table 3.1 on page 36) and the plural is οι 
πίτσες. If it doesn’t, the ending remains untouched and the plural is signaled by the article 
alone: τo γκαράζ / τα γκαράζ, το κομπιούτερ / τα κομπιούτερ. Notice that “euro” in Modern 
Greek falls into this category (το ευρώ / τα ευρώ).
• Compared to the singular, the boundaries among gender groups in the plural seem to be 
less fixed. First, the article of masculine nouns in the nominative is now identical to that of 
feminine ones:
(21) ο δρόμος  οι δρόμοι
 η ώρα   οι ώρες 
Second, two subcategories of masculine nouns share the same endings with the feminine nouns. 
(22) o άντρας  οι άντρες
 ο χάρτης  οι χάρτες
 η ώρα   οι ώρες
 η ζώνη  οι ζώνες
This sort of “fusion” among gender groups supports the idea that you cannot guess gender 
based simply on the endings of the words. Instead you must have an a priori piece of infor-
mation about gender in order to survive in this field.
• The plural is constructed in two ways. First, the ending of the singular may be replaced by 
a new one. 
(23) δρόμος  →  δρόμοι
 ώρα   →  ώρες
 βιβλίο   →  βιβλία
Second, the ending of the singular may stay, receiving an additional unit:
(24) το παιδί  →  τα παιδιά
 το πράγμα  →  τα πράγματα
This latter change is typical of two subcategories of neuter nouns (those ending in -ι and those 

--- Page 55 ---

Chapter 3 | More about Nouns: Nominative and Accusative Cases
Page 46
ending in -μα).
Neuter nouns in -μα get longer in the plural, because they get an additional syllable: 
(VI) πράγμα  →  πράγματα  (“thing” → “things”)
 διαμέρισμα  →  διαμερίσματα   (“apartment” → “apartments”)
How to explain the different position of the stress in the second example? I will remind 
you that the stress in Modern Greek is restricted to one of the last three syllables (check 
Unit 1.2 on page 6). Διαμέρισμα is OK in this respect, but when the noun gets an addi-
tional syllable, things are not OK any longer. The stress will now be on the fourth syllable 
(a real scandal according to stress standards). This is why the stress moves to what is now 
the third syllable of the word.
Neuter nouns in -ι get an additional unit, but they do not become longer. Why? Unit 1.6.2 
on page 13 is here to explain this paradox (a Greek word again). The [i] sound of the 
ending is unstressed, either because the stress was on another syllable, or because the ad-
ditional unit gets its stress. So [i] goes away and the word preserves the same number of 
syllables:
(VII) παιδί   →  παιδιά  (“kid” → “kids”)
 κορίτσι  →  κορίτσια  (“girl” → “girls”)
I believe it is time to show how grammar can help with spelling. Let’s take the vowel [i] 
and its various representations: The letter η is typical of feminine and masculine nouns in 
the singular (η ζώνη, ο χάρτης). The letter ι is typical of neuters (το σπίτι). The combina-
tion οι is typical of articles and masculine nouns in the plural (οι δρόμοι, οι ώρες). The 
letter υ and the combination ει play no significant role here.
Let’s take the [o] sound now. Apparently it is the letter ο that pulls the strings here, as a 
typical letter for masculines and neuters in the singular (ο δρόμος, το βιβλίο).
These are the basics you must know about the plural, but they are not enough for everyday 
communication. I mean you cannot rationalize (“OK, now I want to use the word διαμέρισμα, 
it’s a neuter and gets an additional syllable, but I also have to move the stress”) and speak at 
the same time. The best way to go through the plural (and the singular as well) is memorization 
and practice. This statement sounds contradictory (why then bother to write grammars, or even 
grammar notes?), but it is not. Rationalization (what most grammars do) helps people insert 

--- Page 56 ---

Chapter 3 | More about Nouns: Nominative and Accusative Cases
Page 47
some order into chaos so as to get on with the real language. In this respect, grammar is only 
the first step to communication.
Uncountable nouns (words like water, beer, flour, sugar) behave like ordinary nouns in 
Modern Greek and are totally acceptable in the plural, under a specific reading:
(VIII) Θα ήθελα δύο νερά.
In the above sentence “two waters” means “two glasses (or bottles) of water”.
Notice that in content relations uncountable nouns always keep the singular, regardless of 
the number of containers. Countable nouns, on the other hand, are always in the plural:
(IXa) Θα ήθελα ένα ποτήρι νερό.
 “I’d like a glass of water.”
(IXb) Θα ήθελα δύο ποτήρια νερό. 
  “I’d like two glasses of water.”
(IXc) Θα ήθελα ένα κιλό πορτοκάλια.
 “I’d like one kilo of oranges.”
(IXd) Θα ήθελα δύο κιλά πορτοκάλια.
 “I’d like two kilos of oranges.”
Sometimes languages behave differently regarding number. English nouns referring to 
money or news have only singular number, but the Modern Greek words are in the plural 
(τα λεφτά, τα νέα). On the other hand, “trousers” in Modern Greek is not plural but singular 
(το παντελόνι).
3.4 Modern Greek Nouns in Three Steps
After an exhausting chapter like 3, it is time to summarize what you must know in order to use 
a Modern Greek noun properly. Let’s take a new noun, to let some fresh air in here. This noun 
is υπολογιστής. 
• First you must know what the noun means. Open the dictionary and you will find out it 
means “computer”. At this moment (don’t leave it for later) check the gender. It’s a mascu-
line, and you must remember it (ο υπολογιστής). 
• Then you must know what different forms υπολογιστής takes according to number and 
case. Go back to Table 3.1 on page 36 and check masculines. Υπολογιστής looks more 
like χάρτης because they share the same ending (the position of the stress is irrelevant 
here). What you have now is an appropriate inflectional model, which you can apply to 
υπολογιστής (along with lots of similar nouns) and get the following forms: ο υπολογιστής 

--- Page 57 ---

Chapter 3 | More about Nouns: Nominative and Accusative Cases
Page 48
/ τον υπολογιστή / οι υπολογιστές / τους υπολογιστές.
• The above forms are useless unless combined with syntactic rules which tell you how to 
use them in communication. At this point you must go back to Unit 3.2 on page 37 and 
refresh your memory about the use of cases. Remember: You may be a master of case as 
form, but if you don’t know the rules of use, then you simply cannot say anything bigger 
than a word. 
Keep in mind that knowledge of the theory does not guarantee proper use. You’ll need lots of 
practice afterwards. People make mistakes in the beginning, but this is part of learning anyway.
Craving for Meaning
From Chapter 2 and on, meaning is leaving the background to come to the foreground (it’s 
all about communication, after all). It is time then to introduce two basic questions that 
might help with meaning:
• Suppose you come across a new word (τραπέζι, for example) and want to ask about its 
meaning. What you must ask is this:
(X) Τι σημαίνει “τραπέζι”?
 “What is the meaning of ‘τραπέζι’ ”?
What you will get as an answer is this:
(XI) Σημαίνει “table”.
 “It means ‘table’ ”. 
The same question applies not only to words, but also to larger units, like phrases or sen-
tences. 
• Suppose now you are writing an essay in Modern Greek and you need to know the 
Modern Greek word for “table”. What you must ask now is this:
(XII) Πώς λέμε “table” στα ελληνικά;
 “How do we say ‘table’ in Modern Greek?”
Now you get the following answer:
(XIII) Το λέμε “τραπέζι”.
 “We call it ‘τραπέζι’ ”. 
In the first case you start from the form of a Modern Greek word and get its meaning (rep-
resented by its equivalent in English or any language). In the second case you start from 
meaning (represented by an equivalent word in English or any language) in order to get the 
form of the Modern Greek word.

The Modern Greek περίπτερο
I believe you all are familiar with those tiny kiosks standing on Greek streets surrounded 
by various stands and fridges. Each one of them is an all-service shop. Some of them may 
sell practically everything, from papers, books and cigarettes, to milk, beverages, choco-
lates, even over-the-counter pain killers. Well, it is not exactly everything (you cannot buy 
bread, meat or vegetables there), but it is definitely the place to go when you need to buy 
everyday stuff and you don’t want to visit three stores instead or these stores are closed. 
Going to the περίπτερο is like a crash course in Modern Greek nouns. 
• Don’t forget to use the accusative when asking for something:
(XIVa)  Θα ήθελα έναν χυμό πορτοκάλι. (=“I would like an orange juice.”)
(XIVb)  Έναν χυμό πορτοκάλι, παρακαλώ. (=“An orange juice, please.”)
• If you need more, then it is time to refresh the plural:
(XV)  Δύο χυμούς πορτοκάλι, παρακαλώ.
• Let’s remember that loanwords do not change in the plural, but some of them do:
(XVIa)  Δύο κρουασάν, παρακαλώ. 
(XVIb)  Δύο σοκολάτες, παρακαλώ.
• It is now time to pay. But first you need to ask about the price:
(XVIIa) Πόσο κάνει ο χυμός;
  “How much is the juice?”
(ΧVIIb) Πόσο κάνουν οι χυμοί;
  “How much are the juices?”
At this very moment going to the mini market looks far more attractive than before. After 
all, you just pick what you need, pay and go. But then you miss a vital piece of the Modern 
Greek culture and a great opportunity for practice. Take it and go!
SUMMARY
Nominative and accusative cases are related to major syntactic roles within the sentence, and 
therefore are crucial for communication. Chapter 3 examines the various forms a Modern 
Greek noun may take regarding case. A great deal of the chapter is dedicated to case in use, 
examining basic syntactic contexts for the nominative and the accusative.

CHAPTER 4 | More about Verbs: The Modern Greek Present Tense
The Modern Greek present tense is both good and bad news for absolute beginners. Let’s start 
with the good news. Check the following sentences:
(1a) Bλέπω τηλεόραση τώρα.
 “I am watching TV now.”
(1b) Bλέπω τηλεόραση κάθε μέρα.
 “I watch TV every day.”
Sentence 1a describes an ongoing action in the present. Sentence 1b describes a routine action, 
whose performance includes the present. The verb is different in the English sentences, but in 
the Modern Greek sentences it remains the same. 
I believe it is clear that the Modern Greek present is not a simple or a continuous present. 
It is both. Therefore, don’t look for another present tense in Modern Greek, because there is 
none. And this is really great news for you: You simply have to bother only with one tense in 
the present, not two. 
It is now time for the bad news. Here are the first person singular and first person plural of some 
basic Modern Greek verbs:
(2a) κάνω   κάνουμε  (“I do” / “we do”)
 τρώω   τρώμε   (“I eat” / “we eat”)
 μιλάω/-ώ  μιλάμε  (“Ι speak” / “we speak”)
 μπορώ  μπορούμε  (“I can” / “we can”)
(2b) έρχομαι  ερχόμαστε  (“I come” / “we come”)
 θυμάμαι  θυμόμαστε  (“I remember” / “we remember”)
Modern Greek verbs in the present tense are not uniform in their endings. Verbs belonging to 2a 
share roughly the same endings in the first person singular but have slightly different endings in 
the first person plural. On the contrary, verbs belonging to 2b look the same regarding the first 
person plural, but their ending is slightly different in the first person singular. Obviously what 
lies behind these verbs is not a single but several inflectional patterns. There is then a lot to be 
said about the form of the present tense, and this is what I am going to do in the following unit.

--- Page 61 ---

Chapter 4 | More about Verbs: The Modern Greek Present Tense
Page 52
4.1 The Form of the Present 
As mentioned previously, the Modern Greek present is easy to use, but not that easy to form. 
Verbs follow different inflectional patterns, as shown in example 2. What we need then is a 
categorization frame to put verbs in and to group them around an inflectional model. Let’s see 
how this goes:
Check again the verbs in 2. The maximal difference lies beteween the verbs in 2a and those 
in 2b (compare κάνω / κάνουμε to έρχομαι / ερχόμαστε). It is reasonable then to use voice (see 
Unit 2.2.4 on page 30) as a first step in order to categorize verbs, and this is what most gram -
mars do: Modern Greek verbs are first divided into “active” and “passive” verbs according to 
their endings in the first person singular of the present tense. If a verb ends in -ω, it belongs to 
the “active” group. If a verb ends in -μαι, then it belongs to the “passive” group.
(3) “ACTIVE” GROUP   “PASSIVE” GROUP
 κάνω     έρχομαι
 τρώω     θυμάμαι
 μιλάω/-ώ
 μπορώ
This distinction is very clear, I guess, but still some practice wouldn’t harm. What about the 
following verbs? Think first and then check the answer after 4 (and don’t cheat!). 
(4) σκέφτομαι (“to think”), πλένω (“to wash”), 
 λέω (“to say”, “to tell”), φοβάμαι (“to fear”)
(OK, πλένω, λέω are “active”, σκέφτομαι, φοβάμαι are “passive”.)
Each one of these two major groups is categorized again and again into several groups. Let’s 
start with “active” verbs. They are divided into two major groups, A and B, according to the 
position of the stress. If the stress falls on the stem of the verb, and therefore the ending is not 
stressed, the verb belongs to group A. If the stress falls on the ending of the verb, and therefore 
the stem is unstressed, then the verb belongs to group B. 
(5)    “ACTIVE” VERBS
 GROUP A       GROUP B
 κάνω, τρώω       μιλάω/-ώ, μπορώ
Again some practice might help. Which one of the following verbs is group A and which is 
group B? Think first, then check the answer after 6: 

--- Page 62 ---

Chapter 4 | More about Verbs: The Modern Greek Present Tense
Page 53
(6) παίζω (“to play”), προσπαθώ (“to try”), φοράω/-ώ (“to wear”), τρέχω (“to run”) 
(OK, παίζω, τρέχω belong to group A, προσπαθώ, φοράω/-ώ belong to group B.)
Groups A and B are further divided into two sub-groups each. 
Group A gives A1 and A2 on the basis of the stem: Ιf its final sound is a consonant, then the 
verb goes to A1. If its final sound is a vowel, then the verb goes to A2. 
(7)     GROUP A
  A 1         A 2
  κάνω         τρώω
Group B gives B1 and B2 on the basis of the ending: If there is an -ά- in it, then the verb goes 
to B1. If there is no -ά- in it, then the verb goes to B2.
(8)     GROUP B
  B 1         B 2
  μιλάω/-ώ      μπορώ
This is it! No more groups and subgroups for “active” verbs. Here is a table to help:
“ACTIVE” VERBS
A B
A1 A2 B1 B2
κάνω τρώω μιλάω/-ώ μπορώ
Table 4.1: Basic Inflectional Groups of “Active” Verbs in the Present Tense.
Some practice is necessary, don’t you think? OK, which verb is in which group? Think and 
then you know what to do. But I believe you need some help at the moment, so I will split the 
verbs for you.
(9) γυρίζω (“to turn”, “to return”), μετράω/-ώ (“to count”, “to measure”), καίω (“to burn”), 
 τηλεφωνώ (“to call”), ακούω (“to listen”, “to hear”), δουλεύω (“to work”), 
 τελειώνω (“to finish”, “to end”), αγαπάω/-ώ (“to love”), φτιάχνω (“to make”)
(And here is the answer: γυρίζω, δουλεύω, τελειώνω, φτιάχνω are A1, ακούω, καίω are A2, 

--- Page 63 ---

Chapter 4 | More about Verbs: The Modern Greek Present Tense
Page 54
μετράω/-ώ, αγαπάω/-ώ are B1 and τηλεφωνώ is B2.)
• The verb δουλεύω belongs to A1 group. The letter υ here represents [v], therefore a 
consonant (see Unit 1.4.2 on page 10).
• Take the verbs τελειώνω and τηλεφωνώ to see how stress affects their categorization. 
The first one is stressed on the stem, therefore it goes to A1. The second one is stressed 
on the ending, therefore it goes to B2. 
“Passive” verbs follow the distinctions of “active” verbs. Considering that “passive” voice is 
basically examined in levels B1-B2, I will skip a detailed presentation and focus only on two 
groups of “passive” verbs:
• The first group consists of verbs ending in - ομαι, like έρχομαι. In order to save time and 
energy I will call it “passive” group 1.
• The second group is a rather limited group consisting of verbs ending in -άμαι, like θυμάμαι. 
Let’s call it “passive” group 2. 
In the following units you will find tables representing “active” groups A1, A2, B1, B2 and 
the two “passive” groups. Each group is presented as an inflectional model. This model can be 
applied to all verbs of each group. The verbal forms of each inflectional model are represented 
first as whole, then split into the stem and the ending. The endings alone come last. Each inflec-
tional model is followed by a list of basic verbs for levels A1-A2. 
Personal pronouns are optional (see Unit 2.2.1 on page 26) but still necessary. They will 
be introduced with group A1 but will not be mentioned in the following groups.
4.1.1 Group A1: κάνω
Verbs in group A1 have an unstressed ending. The final sound of the stem is a consonant.
SINGULAR
1st (εγώ) κάνω κάνω -ω
2nd (εσύ) κάνεις κάνεις -εις
3rd (αυτός/αυτή/αυτό) κάνει κάνει -ει
PLURAL
1st (εμείς) κάνουμε κάνουμε -ουμε
2nd (εσείς) κάνετε κάνετε -ετε
3rd (αυτοί/αυτές/αυτά) κάνουν(ε) κάνουν(ε) -ουν(ε)

Τhe third person plural has alternative forms (κάνουν /κάνουνε). As absolute beginners, 
you are free to use any one of them.
Of all groups, A1 is by far the largest. The vast majority of basic Modern Greek verbs belong 
to group A1 (for more verbs, see the Appendix on page 162).
αγοράζω (“to buy”) αλλάζω (“to change”) ανοίγω (“to open”)
αρέσει (“to like”) αρχίζω (“to start”) αφήνω (“to leave”, “to let”)
βγαίνω (“to go out”) βλέπω (“to see”, “to watch”) βρίσκω (“to find”)
γράφω (“to write”) γυρίζω (“to turn”, to “return”) διαβάζω (“to read”, “to study”)
δίνω (“to give”) δουλεύω (“to work”) έχω (“to have”)
θέλω (“to want”) κάνω (“to do”) κλείνω (“to close”)
κοιτάζω (“to look”, “to stare”) μαγειρεύω (“to cook”) μαθαίνω (“to learn”)
μένω (“to live”, “to stay”) μπαίνω (“to enter”, “to go in”) νομίζω (“to think”)
ξέρω (“to know”) παίρνω (“to take”, “to get”) πίνω (“to drink”)
πρέπει (“must”, “have to”) στέλνω (“to send”) τελειώνω (“to end”, “to finish”)
υπάρχει (“there is”) φέρνω (“to bring”, “to fetch”) φεύγω (“to leave”)
φτάνω (“to arrive”) φτιάχνω (“to make”, “to fix”) χάνω (“to loose”, “to miss”)
χορεύω (“to dance”) ψάχνω (“to look for”) ψωνίζω (“to shop”)
Table 4.3: Basic Verbs of Group A1.
Three of the above verbs are entered in the third person singular instead of the first person 
singular. Πρέπει is an impersonal verb (to be examined in Chapter 9). Αρέσει and υπάρχει 
come most of the times as third-person verbs because of their syntax in Modern Greek.
4.1.2 Group A2: τρώω
Verbs in group A2 have an unstressed ending. The final sound of the stem is a vowel.
SINGULAR
1st τρώω τρώω -ω
2nd τρως τρως -ς
3rd τρώει τρώει -ει

1st τρώμε τρώμε -με
2nd τρώτε τρώτε -τε
3rd τρώνε τρώνε -νε
Table 4.4: An Ιnflectional Model for Group A2.
Group A2 comprises only few verbs, but all of them are basic for communication: 
ακούω (“to hear”, “to listen”) καίω (“to burn”) κλαίω (“to cry”)
λέω (“to say”, “to tell”) πάω (“to go”) τρώω (“to eat”)
φταίω (“to be responsible for sοmething negative”, “to be blamed for something”)
Table 4.5: Basic Verbs of Group A2.
The verb πάω has an alternative form (πηγαίνω), which belongs to group A1.
4.1.3 Group B1: μιλάω/-ώ
Verbs in group B1 have a stressed ending. The first series of their endings include -ά-.
SINGULAR
1st μιλάω/μιλώ μιλάω/μιλώ -άω/-ώ
2nd μιλάς μιλάς -άς
3rd μιλάει/μιλά μιλάει/μιλά -άει/-ά
PLURAL
1st μιλάμε/μιλούμε μιλάμε/μιλούμε -άμε/-ούμε
2nd μιλάτε μιλάτε -άτε
3rd μιλάνε/μιλούν μιλάνε/ μιλούν -άνε/-ούν
Table 4.6: An Inflectional Model for Group B1.
Group B1 is the second biggest group after A1, comprising lots of basic verbs: 
αγαπάω/-ώ (“to love”) απαντάω/-ώ (“to answer”, “to reply”)
γελάω/-ώ (“to laugh”) διψάω/-ώ (“to be thirsty”)
ζητάω/-ώ (“to ask [as in requests]”) κρατάω/-ώ (“to hold”, “to last”)
μετράω/-ώ (“to count”, “to measure”) μιλάω/-ώ (“to speak”, “to talk”)
Table 4.7: Basic Verbs of Group B1.

--- Page 66 ---

Chapter 4 | More about Verbs: The Modern Greek Present Tense
Page 57
ξυπνάω/-ώ (“to wake up”) πεινάω/-ώ (“to be hungry”)
περνάω/-ώ (“to pass”, to cross”) περπατάω/-ώ (“to walk”)
προτιμάω/-ώ (“to prefer”) ρωτάω/-ώ (“to ask [as in questions]”)
σταματάω/-ώ (“ to stop”) φοράω/-ώ (“to wear”)
Table 4.7: Basic Verbs of Group B1.
Verbs like μιλάω are present in a great variety of alternative forms. These forms have 
almost equal status in speech. Why “almost equal”? Because the lenghty forms (μιλάω, 
μιλάει etc.) represent a more colloquial, everyday style, and the short forms (μιλώ, μιλά 
etc.) a slightly more formal and literary style. In principle you are free to use any one of the 
two. But as absolute beginners you are advised to focus on the lengthy forms, so as not to 
confuse verbs in group B1 with verbs in group B2 (for example the short form μιλώ looks 
exactly like μπορώ) .
Considering that groups A2 and B1 share roughly the same inflectional pattern, one might 
wonder why we need to posit two separate groups. The answer is this: Though these verbs 
look very much alike, they behave differently in several respects. Verbs like μιλάω may 
also have a contracted form (see the above table), while verbs like τρώω cannot (this is 
why grammars split the verbs like μιλάω and τρώω). Verbs like μιλάω are regular verbs in 
the past and the future, while verbs like τρώω are not. These are the main reasons why we 
should maintain a distinction among these groups.
4.1.4 Group B2: μπορώ
Verbs in group B2 have a stressed ending. Their endings do not include -ά-.
SINGULAR
1st μπορώ μπορώ -ώ
2nd μπορείς μπορείς -είς
3rd μπορεί μπορεί -εί
PLURAL
1st μπορούμε μπορούμε -ούμε
2nd μπορείτε μπορείτε -είτε

Among the basic verbs of this group we can list the following:
ζω (“to live”, “to be alive”) μπορώ (“can”) οδηγώ (“drive”)
προσπαθώ (“to try”) τηλεφωνώ (“to call”) χρησιμοποιώ (“to use”)
Table 4.9: Basic Verbs of Group Β2.
4.1.5 “Passive” Group 1: έρχομαι
Verbs of this group include -o- as part of their ending.
SINGULAR
1st έρχομαι έρχομαι -ομαι
2nd έρχεσαι έρχεσαι -εσαι
3rd έρχεται έρχεται -εται
PLURAL
1st ερχόμαστε ερχόμαστε -όμαστε
2nd ερχόσαστε/έρχεστε ερχόσαστε/έρχεστε -όσαστε/-εστε
3rd έρχονται έρχονται -ονται
Table 4.10: An Inflectional Model for “Passive” Group 1.
Some basic verbs of this group are the following: 
γίνομαι (“to become”) έρχομαι (“to come”) κάθομαι (“to sit”)
πλένομαι (“to wash myself”) σκέφτομαι (“to think”)
Table 4.11: Basic Verbs of “Passive” Group 1.
Though the number of “passive” verbs at Levels A1-Α2 may seem limited, in fact they rep-
resent an enormous group. Some of them stand as the “reflexive” counterpart of “active” 
verbs of group A1:
(I) πλένω    πλένομαι
 “wash something”  “wash myself”
As absolute beginners, you are free to use anyone of the alternative types of the second 
person plural. The same holds for every “passive” verb.

4.1.6 “Passive” Group 2: θυμάμαι
Verbs of this group include -ά- as part of their ending.
SINGULAR

Table 4.12: An Inflectional Model for “Passive” Group 2.
The group comprises only four verbs, namely: 
θυμάμαι (“to remember”) κοιμάμαι (“to sleep”)
λυπάμαι (“to feel sorry”, “to be sorry”) φοβάμαι (“to be afraid”, “to fear”)
Table 4.13: Verbs of “Passive” Group 2.
4.1.7 Where is the Verb “to be”?
The verb “to be” stands alone here, because it can be nowhere else. In principle είμαι is a 
“passive” verb, but its endings look like no “passive” group here (there is no - o- or -ά- in the 
ending) or elsewhere. In other words, είμαι is a typical irregular verb. So you will have to mem-
orize the following table only for the sake of είμαι. And if you are wondering why είμαι has to 
be irregular after all, note that the verb “to be” happens to be irregular across several languages 
(English included).

4.1.8 Modern Greek Verbs in Two Steps
To the eyes of the absolute beginner, Units 4.1.1-4.1.7 must look like a nightmare. “How do I 
know where a specific verb belongs?” is the obvious question. Well, there are simple steps for 
it. Let’ see the following sentence: 
(10) Ο Πέτρος μαθαίνει ισπανικά. 
 “Peter is learning Spanish.”
• In order to find which category the verb μαθαίνει belongs to, go to the first person singu -
lar of the present. This is not hard. Verbs are entered like this in dictionaries. If you are in 
class, the teacher will give you the first person singular as well. In our case the first person 
singular of the verb is μαθαίνω. If you are a mastermind of grammar, perhaps you are able 
by now to track similarities with a specific model and go to the first person. 
• Let’s now put μαθαίνω under the microscope. Check the ending first. Μαθαίνω is clearly 
an “active” verb. Now check the stem. The stem is stressed, so you go to group A. Check 
the stem again. The final sound is a consonant, so you go to group A1.  Now you are ready 
to apply the inflectional model of A1 (Table 4.2 on page 54) to μαθαίνω and live happily 
ever after.
4.2 The Use of the Present 
The use of the Modern Greek present is roughly equivalent to the use of the English simple and 
continuous presents together. Basically the Modern Greek present is used to describe: 
• Αctions that happen at the present (keep I mind that the term “present” should be under -
stood as the moment of speaking):
(11) Φεύγω τώρα.
 “I am leaving now.”
• Actions that repeat themselves in a pattern that includes the present. In this respect the 
Modern Greek present is used to describe everyday routines, scheduled events or even 
general truths. 
(12a) O Πέτρος πάντα ξυπνάει στις οχτώ το πρωί.
 “Peter always wakes up at eight a.m.”
(12b) Το τρένο φεύγει στις οχτώ.”
 “The train leaves at eight o’clock.”

--- Page 70 ---

Chapter 4 | More about Verbs: The Modern Greek Present Tense
Page 61
(12c) Η Γη γυρίζει γύρω από τον Ήλιο.
 “The Earth goes around the Sun.”
• Actions that started in the past, but continue in the present (notice that in this context the 
Modern Greek present equals the English present perfect continuous).
(13) Δουλεύω από το πρωί.
 “Ι have been working since morning.” 
Accordingly, the present combines with three major groups of adverbials:
• Adverbs related to the present:
τώρα (“now”) σήμερα (“today”)
απόψε (“tonight”) φέτος (“this year”)
Table 4.15: Adverbs Related to the Present Tense.
• Adverbs of frequency (they are provided below on a frequency scale):
πάντα “always”
συνήθως “usually”
συχνά “often”
μερικές φορές/ πότε πότε “some times”
σπάνια “rarely”
(δεν) ___ ποτέ “(not) ever” (=“never”)
Table 4.16: Adverbs of Frequency.
Αdverbs of frequency represent another instance of free word order in Modern Greek: Un-
like English, these adverbs may hold several positions within the sentence: 
(IIa) Συνήθως πίνω καφέ.
(IIb) Πίνω συνήθως καφέ.
(IIc) Πίνω καφέ συνήθως.
All of the above sentences mean “I usually have coffee”.
• Single (non-prepositional) accusative (see Unit 3.2.5 on page 42). The accusative may 
also be modified by the word κάθε to express frequency or by other words related to the 
present:

--- Page 71 ---

Chapter 4 | More about Verbs: The Modern Greek Present Tense
Page 62
(14a) Δουλεύω την Τρίτη.
 “I work on Tuesday.”
(14b) Δουλεύω κάθε Τρίτη.
 “I work every Tuesday.”
(14c) Δουλεύω αυτή την Τρίτη.
 “I am working this Tuesday. ”
Apart from describing present actions, the Modern Greek present may also refer to actions 
that belong to the future (usually the immediate future):
(III) Πάω στην Ιταλία την άλλη Τρίτη.
 “ I’m going to Italy next Tuesday.”
Going to Italy seems to be a very strong possibility, a fact that relates the use of the present 
here to modality (see Unit 2.2.3 on page 30). 
The same holds for the following sentence:
(IV) A: Ποιος θα πάει για καφέ;
 B: Πάω εγώ.
 “Who will go to get some coffee?”
 “I am willing / I am ready / I can go [to get some coffee].”
Πάω in this context expresses ability, which again belongs to the area of modality.

Chapter 4 | More about Verbs: The Modern Greek Present Tense

A User-Friendly Tense
I kept the best part for the end: The Modern Greek present needs no auxiliaries and rele -
vant syntactic changes in order to form its interrogative or negative version: 
(Va) Θέλει παγωτό.
 “She/He wants ice cream.”
(Vb) Θέλει παγωτό;
 “ Does she/he want ice cream?”
(Vc) Δεν θέλει παγωτό.
 “She/He doesn’t want ice cream.”
In Modern Greek, in order to ask a yes-no question (sentence Vb) all you have to do is 
change your intonation (see Unit 1.7.2 on page 16). In order to refuse or deny (sentence 
Vc) you just add the negative particle δεν before the verb. In both cases you skip all formal 
changes involved in languages like English. The Modern Greek present then is an “aux-
iliary-free” tense and this is true about the Modern Greek past and the future (you will be 
reminded later about this).
• If you want to ask a question starting with an interrogative word, you simply put this 
word first and follow the intonation pattern for questions:
(VI) Tι θέλει;
 “ What does she/he want?”
Notice, though, that when the sentence includes an explicit subject, it is usually posited 
after the verb:
(VII) Τι θέλει η Ελένη;
 “What does Helen want?”

Νιάου! 
Cats sound much the same everywhere, but people across cultures seem to hear them dif-
ferently. In human terms, Modern Greek cats say νιάου! Dogs say γαβ! Hens say κο, κο, κο! 
while roosters say κικιρίκου! Sheep and goats say μπεεε! Cows say μουουουου! Birds say 
τσίου, τσίου!  And fish say nothing at all.
If you wish to call a cat, what you should do is ψι,ψι,ψι,ψι. If you wish to call a dog, 
what you should do is a sound like a kiss. If you want to send them away (but I hope you 
don’t) what you should do is ξουτ!
There are several verbs to describe animal voices, among them νιαουρίζω for cats, 
γαβγίζω for dogs, κακαρίζω for hens, μουγκανίζω for cows, τιτιβίζω for birds (and at least 
twenty more in dictionaries). Which group are they? Yes, you guessed right. It’s the al-
mighty group A1.
SUMMARY
Chapter 4 introduces the Modern Greek present tense. Considering that there is not a single 
inflectional model for verbs in the present tense, the greatest part of the chapter is dedicated 
to form, in order to offer a comprehensive categorization frame for basic Modern Greek verbs. 
The use of the present tense is exemplified by typical adverbials related to its use.

Page 66
CHAPTER 5 | Before the Noun: Adjectives and More 
Nouns in use do not usually appear by themselves to form sentences. Let’s start with the fol -
lowing example: 
(1) Ο σκύλος κυνηγάει την γάτα.
 “ The dog is after the cat.”
The nouns σκύλος and γάτα do not stand alone. Both are combined with a form of the definite 
article (see Unit 5.2 on page 68), as parts of a larger unit. Let’s now see the following sen -
tence:
(2) Ο μαύρος σκύλος κυνηγάει την άσπρη γάτα.
 “ The black dog is after the white cat.”
What we have now are two even larger units. They consist of a noun in tandem with the definite 
article and an adjective. Here are two different units:
(3) Ένας σκύλος κυνηγάει δύο γάτες.
 “ A dog is after two cats.”
The first unit consists of a noun preceded by the indefinite article. The second unit consists of 
a noun preceded by a numeral.
What do these units have in common? 
• The noun is an essential part of all such units. Other words, such as articles, adjectives or 
numerals, are not essential. To put it simply: You can remove an adjective and still have 
a meaningful unit. But if you remove the noun, you have nothing. In this sense the noun 
(either present or presumed) is the “head” of these units, and other words are considered to 
be “secondary”. They depend on this “head” noun to exist. 
• These “secondary” words are in fact not secondary at all. They provide extra information 
about the noun, to make communication more effective. This sort of information may be 
abstract/non-descriptive (like in the case of articles) or concrete/descriptive (like in the case 
of adjectives).
• Inside these units, words appear in a certain order. Perhaps you have already noticed that 
the noun keeps the final position and other words precede it. 
In this chapter I am going to deal with this kind of noun-dependent words that precede the 

--- Page 76 ---

Chapter 5 | Before the Noun: Adjectives and More
Page 67
noun, providing extra information about it. We shall then focus on articles, numerals and adjec-
tives. Pronouns represent a peculiar case of noun dependency, therefore they will be examined 
on their own, in Chapter 6. 
Cats and Dogs
The examples of the introduction were taken from the animal kingdom, so let’s stay here 
for a while. Cats and dogs, perhaps the most common pets on the planet, are usually per -
ceived as opposites (you must have heard that if you like cats, then you probably don’t like 
dogs, etc. etc.). Gender draws an interesting distinction among them. The term for male 
dogs (ο σκύλος) may also stand for the species “dog” regardless of sex, while the term for 
female cats (η γάτα) stands for the species “cat”.
5.1 The Grammar of Noun-Dependent Words
Articles, adjectives and other noun-dependent words have a lot in common:
• They are basically inflected words. For example, the Modern Greek adjective meaning 
“expensive” can be found in different forms: 
(4) ακριβός / ακριβή / ακριβό 
I believe it is easy to see the similarity of adjectives to verbs and nouns: The left part is invari-
able and bears lexical information (the adjective means “expensive”). The right part is variable 
and bears grammatical information. What sort of grammatical information? Considering that 
these words are part of a noun phrase (this is the technical term for phrases with a noun as their 
“head”) and provide extra information about the “head” noun, this sort of information is again 
about gender, number and case. Checking the adjective ακριβός in the previous example I can 
tell it’s a masculine and in the singular number, and that its case is the  nominative.
Noun-dependent words are generally entered in dictionaries according to the masculine 
in the nominative singular. So “expensive” is represented as ακριβός, usually followed by 
the feminine and the neuter endings (For a real example press here http://www.greek-lan-
guage.gr/greekLang/modern_greek/tools/lexica/triantafyllides/search.html?lq).
• The use of these forms again is not random. Noun-dependent words must follow the gram-
matical “profile” of the “head” noun. In other words, they must have the same number, 
gender, and case as the noun they depend on (in grammar terminology this is called agree-
ment). Let’s take an example from a field you are familiar with: There is a specific definite 

--- Page 77 ---

Chapter 5 | Before the Noun: Adjectives and More
Page 68
article for each gender category (5a) and there are more if you combine number (5b) and 
case (5c):
(5a) ο αναπτήρας, η ομπρέλα, το βιβλίο
(5b) η ομπρέλα, οι ομπρέλες
(5c) η ομπρέλα, την ομπρέλα
Having these in mind, let’s now take a closer look at each one of these categories.
5.2 The Definite and the Indefinite Articles 
After chapters 2 and 3, I believe that the forms of the definite article must be quite familiar to 
you. If they are not, here is a table to help:
MASCULINE FEMININE NEUTER
SINGULAR
NOM. ο η το
ACC. τον την το
PLURAL
NOM. οι οι τα
ACC. τους τις τα
Table 5.1: The Modern Greek Definite Article (Nominative and Accusative).
In Modern Greek the indefinite article “a(n)” ( ένας) is the same as the numeral “one” ( ένας), 
a coincidence present in many languages (German, French, Spanish among them). What lies 
behind it, is simple reasoning: If I need a coffee, then it is one coffee I need, not two or three.
MASCULINE FEMININE NEUTER
SINGULAR
NOM. ένας μία / μια ένα
ACC. έναν μία / μια ένα
Table 5.2: The Modern Greek Indefinite Article (Nominative and Accusative).
Τhe Modern Greek indefinite article has no plural forms (compare to Spanish and German, 
which do have one). When such forms are necessary, other indefinite words (like the pro-
noun κάποιος, “someone”) do the job instead.

--- Page 78 ---

Chapter 5 | Before the Noun: Adjectives and More
Page 69
The two articles (definite and indefinite) provide abstract information that radically affects the 
reading of the “head” noun. Let’s start with the following sentences:
(6a) Οι σκύλοι έχουν μεγάλα δόντια.
 “ (-) Dogs have big teeth.”
(6b) Ο σκύλος είναι σαρκοφάγο ζώο. 
 “ The dog is a carnivorous animal.” (=Dogs are carnivorous animals.)
In these sentences the “head” noun refers to all dogs. But let’s see the following sentence:
(7) Ο σκύλος γαβγίζει στην πόρτα.
 “ The dog is barking at the door.”
Now the “head” noun does not refer to all dogs, but to a very specific dog. This dog may be 
specific for several reasons. Perhaps it is the only dog around. Perhaps it is the dog of the 
house. Perhaps it was just a dog that became part of the picture because it had previously been 
mentioned. 
I believe it is clear from examples 6 and 7 that the definite article affects the scope of refer-
ence of the “head” noun. In this sense, nouns preceded by the definite article are related either 
to generic (“all”) or specific (“this”) reference. 
The indefinite article moves along similar lines. Let’s see the following sentences:
(8a) Ένας σκύλος τρέχει πάνω από 20 χιλιόμετρα την ώρα.
 “ Α dog can run faster than 20 kms /hour.” (=Dogs can run faster than 20 kms/hour.)
(8b) Ένας σκύλος γαβγίζει στην πόρτα.
 “ A dog is barking at the door.”
Sentence 8a represents another version of generic reference. Any dog can run faster than 20 
kms per hour. Sentence 8b represents another version of specific reference (now it is some un-
known dog, not a specific dog, which is barking at the door). 
Both articles then may be related to generic and specific reference, but in a different way: 
All is not exactly any, as this is not exactly some. We could then say that the definite article 
imposes a definite reading of the “head” noun, either generic or specific. The indefinite article 
in its turn imposes an indefinite reading of the “head” noun, either generic or specific.

Page 70
ARTICLE REFERENCE MEANING
DEFINITE DEFINITE-GENERIC “all”
DEFINITE-SPECIFIC “this”
INDEFINITE ΙNDEFINITE-GENERIC “any”
INDEFINITE-SPECIFIC “some”
Table 5.3: The Use of the Definite and the Indefinite Articles.
These distinctions are important as general guidelines to help you deal with the definite and the 
indefinite articles in Modern Greek. It will be hard, especially for people whose mother tongue 
has no such articles. What you should have in mind is this:
• The definite article is strongly related to generic definiteness. It is then obligatory in all 
sorts of generic statements (compare to English):
(9a) Μου αρέσει ο καφές.
 “I like (-) coffee.”
(9b) Οι γάτες μισούν το νερό.
 “ (-) Cats hate (-) water.”
The definite article is strongly related to specific definiteness, too. This fact explains why it 
is obligatory with proper nouns (par excellence specific nouns, referring to unique entities). 
Compare again to English: 
(10a) ο Πέτρος, η Μαρία
 “ (-) Peter”, “(-) Mary”
(10b) η Γαλλία, η Αθήνα, τα Χριστούγεννα
 “ (-) France”, “(-) Athens”, “(-) Christmas”
This fact also explains why the definite article is obligatory with words specifying a noun, like 
demonstrative or possessive pronouns (see Units 6.2 on page 85 and 10.2.3 on page 144):
(11a) Αυτό το βιβλίο είναι ακριβό.
 “ This (-) book is expensive.”
(11b) Ψάχνω το βιβλίο μου.
 “Ι am looking for (-) my book.”

--- Page 80 ---

Chapter 5 | Before the Noun: Adjectives and More
Page 71
• The indefinite article is less strongly related to indefiniteness, either generic or specific. 
Syntax seems to play an important role here. If the definite article depends on a noun in 
the subject position, it is obligatory in its generic use. In its specific use, though, it may be 
replaced by other indefinite words, like κάποιος.
(12a) Ένα παιδί πρέπει να ακούει τους γονείς του  (GENERIC)
 “ Α child should listen to its parents.” 
 (=Children should listen to their parents.)
(12b) Ένας φίλος / Κάποιος φίλος λέει ότι...   (SPECIFIC)
 “ Α friend / Some friend says that…”
Let’s see what happens when the indefinite article depends on a noun in the object position.
(13a) Ψάχνω μια / κάποια δουλειά για το πρωί.   (SPECIFIC)
 “I am looking for a morning job.”
(13b) Ψάχνω μια δουλειά.      (GENERIC)
 “I am looking for a job.”
Sentence 13a is specific. If I am looking for a morning job, some job will be OK for me. Sen-
tence 13b on the contrary is generic. If I am an unemployed person, then any job will do. But 
let’s look at the following sentence:
(14) Ψάχνω (-) δουλειά.
Now the indefinite article is dropped to form a periphrasis (a Greek word again), whose mean-
ing is slightly different. This sentence focuses on the point that I am looking for a job, and not 
for an apartment or a dog. What is clear now is that I am a “job-seeker”, an unemployed person. 
This sort of connotation is the basis for hundreds of everyday expressions like the following:
(15a) Πίνω (-) καφέ το πρωί.
 “I have a/(-) coffee in the morning.”
(15b) Διαβάζω (-) εφημερίδα.
 “I read the paper.”
(15c) Συνήθως φοράω (-) παντελόνι και (-) μπλουζάκι.
 “Ι usually wear (-) trousers and a t-shirt.”

--- Page 81 ---

Chapter 5 | Before the Noun: Adjectives and More
Page 72
(15d) Έχω (-) μεγάλη μύτη.
 “I’ve got a big nose.”
The point in the above sentences is that I am a “coffee-lover” (as in 15a), a “paper-reader” (as 
in 15b), I am a person wearing trousers and t-shirts (as in 15c) or that my nose is big (as in 15d). 
This fact brings such sentences close to predicate structures such as the following, where (once 
again) the indefinite article is dropped:
 
(16a) Ο Πέτρος είναι (-) γιατρός.
 “Peter is a doctor.”
(16b) O Μαξ είναι (-) σκύλος, όχι (-) γάτα.
 “Max is a dog, not a cat.”
Friends and Partners
Modern Greek people, especially teenagers, refer to their partner using the noun φίλος/φίλη 
(“male friend” / “female friend”) with the definite article. If they refer to a simple friend of 
theirs, they use the same noun, but this time with the indefinite article:
(Ia)  Mένω με τον φίλο μου.
 “I live with my boyfriend.”
(Ib)  Mένω με έναν φίλο μου.
 “I live with a friend of mine.”
This is a very clear instance of the difference between the definite and the indefinite article. 
A boyfriend in this respect seems to be a very specific (or should I say special?) friend, a 
unique friend. On the contrary, a friend is just a friend among other friends.
The difference is far from clear-cut, and frankly there are instances where it is hard (even 
for natives) to tell if someone refers to her/his partner or to a friend of hers/his. In order to 
avoid misunderstandings, try not to use this term to refer to your partner, and choose anoth-
er way (I am sure your teenage Greek friends will be far greater help than me in this field).
5.3 Numerals and More
The Modern Greek numeral system is purely decimal, with bigger units preceding smaller 
ones. The number 172, for example, is:
(17) 100   70   2
 εκατόν   (-) εβδομήντα  δύο
 “one hundred  and seventy  two”

--- Page 82 ---

Chapter 5 | Before the Noun: Adjectives and More
Page 73
The numeral system looks very much like the English one, so there are few things to be said 
here. Just make sure you know the basics from 1 to 100 (press here for numbers 1-100: http://
www.foundalis.com/lan/grknum.htm).
The vast majority of numerals are not inflected, so they remain the same regardless of the actual 
gender or case of the “head” noun: 
(18a) δύο χάρτες  (MASCULINE)
 “ two maps”
(18b) δύο καρέκλες  (FEMININE)
 “ two chairs”
(18c) δύο βιβλία  (NEUTER)
 “ two books”
But rules always have an exception, and here we have three: Numerals 1, 3, and 4 are inflected 
words. Numeral 1 is identical to the indefinite article, so go to Table 5.2 on page 68 to see 
how it goes. Numerals 3 and 4 have the same form for masculine and feminine and a different 
one for neuter (and, of course, they have only plural).
MASCULINE FEMININE NEUTER
NOM. τρεις τρεις τρία
ACC. τρεις τρεις τρία

Page 74
What Time Is It?
The basic question about clock time in Modern Greek is this:
(II) Τι ώρα είναι;
 “What time is it?”
Telling the time in Modern Greek involves the following routines: Hours come first, min-
utes come second. The Modern Greek words for “past” and “to” are και and παρά re-
spectively. “Quarter” is τέταρτο and “half” is μισή. Having these in mind, let’s answer the 
question (note that the verb and the expression “o’clock” are usually omitted):
(IIIa) 05.00 Είναι πέντε η ώρα. / Είναι πέντε. / Πέντε.
(IIIb) 05.10 Είναι πέντε και δέκα. / Πέντε και δέκα.
(IIIc) 05.15 Πέντε και τέταρτο.
(IIId) 05.30 Πέντε και μισή.
(IIIe) 05.45 Έξι παρά τέταρτο.
Hours in Modern Greek are feminine (η ώρα). This is why we use μία, τρεις and τέσσερις 
instead of ένα, τρία and τέσσερα.
(IVa) 13.05 Mία και πέντε.
(IVb) 15.00 Τρεις.
(IVc) 16.20 Τέσσερις και δέκα.
The abbreviations a.m./p.m. are π.μ./μ.μ. respectively (yes, the Modern Greek π.μ. corre-
sponds to the English a.m.). They are used in writing but not in speaking. Instead, people 
use periods of the day (such as morning or evening) to specify time:
(Va) 05.00 Πέντε το πρωί.
(Vb) 17.00 Πέντε το απόγευμα.
Numerals express precise quantity. What about imprecise quantity? As in other languages, here 
there are some special words (called general quantifiers, or simply quantifiers) to do the job. 
For levels A1-A2 you need to know only two basic quantifiers, and here they are:
• Large quantity is expressed by πολύς, which is equal to much, a lot of, many. 
• Small quantity is expressed by λίγος, which equals to (a) few, (a) little.
For absolute beginners like you, this is one of the happiest moments of the Modern Greek lan-
guage. So, forget about countable or uncountable nouns, forget about sentence types and enjoy 
quantification!

--- Page 84 ---

Chapter 5 | Before the Noun: Adjectives and More
Page 75
(19a) Δεν έχω πολλά λεφτά.
 “I don’t have much money.”
(19b) Έχω πολλούς καλούς φίλους.
 “I have many good friends.”
(19c) Έχω πολλούς φίλους.
 “I have a lot of friends.”
In order to make this happy moment even happier, I must tell you that relevant adverbs 
derive directly from these quantifiers:
(VIa) Eίναι πολύ έξυπνος.
 “She/He is very clever.”
(VIb) Σε αγαπάω πάρα πολύ.
 “I love you very much.”
(VIc) Τρώω πολύ.
 “I eat a lot.”
The only problem in this field is form. The quantifier λίγος is inflected like an ordinary adjec-
tive (see Table 5.7 on page 76), but the quantifier πολύς is irregular. Here is a table to help:
MASCULINE FEMININE NEUTER
SINGULAR
NOM. πολύς πολλή πολύ
ACC. πολύ πολλή πολύ
PLURAL
NOM. πολλοί πολλές πολλά
ACC. πολλούς πολλές πολλά
Table 5.6: The Quantifier πολύς/πολλή/πολύ (Nominative and Accusative).
A few words now about syntax: Numerals and quantifiers come right after the definite article 
and generally precede ordinary adjectives. In this respect Modern Greek does not differ radi -
cally from English: 
(20a) οι δύο ακριβοί χάρτες
 “ the two expensive maps”

--- Page 85 ---

Chapter 5 | Before the Noun: Adjectives and More
Page 76
(20b) πολλοί ακριβοί χάρτες
 “ many expensive maps”
5.4 Adjectives
Basic Modern Greek adjectives follow two main inflectional models. The only difference be -
tween them is the ending of the feminine (-α vs. -η). I will not engage in a detailed explanation 
and leave it for levels B1-B2; I will give you some practical guidance instead: Focus on the 
masculine of the adjectives ακριβός (“expensive”) and νέος (“young”). If the final sound of the 
stem is a consonant ( ακριβός), the feminine ends in - η (see Table 5.7). If the final sound is a 
vowel (νέος), the feminine ends in -α (see Table 5.8).
Basic Modern Greek adjectives do not have their own morphology. Their inflection follows 
major categories of Modern Greek nouns. The adjectives ακριβός and νέος of our example 
are exactly like masculine nouns in - ος (δρόμος). Ακριβή and νέα are identical to feminine 
nouns in -η or -α (ζώνη, ώρα). Finally, ακριβό and νέο are based on neuter nouns in -o (βιβλίο). 
Therefore, you don’t really have to learn anything new here. All you have to do is refresh your 
knowledge of nouns (see Tables 3.1 on page 36 and 3.4 on page 44) and/or check the fol -
lowing tables: 
MASCULINE FEMININE NEUTER
SINGULAR
NOM. ακριβός ακριβή ακριβό

Chapter 5 | Before the Noun: Adjectives and More
Page 77
What is crucial about adjectives is not form but use. Like other noun-dependent words adjec -
tives must follow the grammatical “profile” of the “head” noun. In grammar terminology, they 
must “agree” with the “head” noun in gender (as in 21a), number (as in 21b) and case (as in 
21c):
(21a) ο ακριβός χάρτης / η ακριβή ζώνη / το ακριβό βιβλίο
(21b) ο ακριβός χάρτης / οι ακριβοί χάρτες
(21c) ο ακριβός χάρτης / τον ακριβό χάρτη
Like many other rules, the rule of agreement looks very nice and clear in theory, but not that 
nice and clear in practice. As absolute beginners, you will most probably make several mis -
takes before you can really master this rule. Don’t get disappointed, it has happened to every -
one before you. 
• Adjectives must follow the noun’s number, gender and case, not their actual endings. 
(VIIa) ακριβός φακός
 “expensive torch”
(VIIb) ακριβός αναπτήρας
 “expensive lighter”
(VIIc) ακριβός χάρτης
 “expensive map”
• Adjectives provide information about nouns not only directly, but also indirectly via 
a verb (usually είμαι, “to be”), again following the rule of agreement. This is another 
instance of predication (see Unit 3.2.2 on page 39).
(VIII) Ο χάρτης είναι ακριβός.
 “ The map is expensive.”
Now, a few words about the position of adjectives. Generally, an adjective must immediately 
precede the noun, which means that it must be closer to it than other words like articles, pro -
nouns (see Chapter 6 on page 82) or numerals:
(22a) Θέλω τον ακριβό χάρτη.
 “I want the expensive map.”
(22b) Θέλω έναν ακριβό χάρτη.
 “I want an expensive map.”

--- Page 87 ---

Chapter 5 | Before the Noun: Adjectives and More
Page 78
(22c) Θέλω αυτόν τον ακριβό χάρτη.
 “I want this expensive map.”
(22d) Θέλω δύο ακριβούς χάρτες.
 “I want two expensive maps.”
What if there are more than one adjectives? If you compare to your own language or Engish, I 
believe you’ll find more similarities than dissimilarities:
(23a) 
  Θέλω ένα ωραίο ζεστό τσάι. 
  “I want a nice hot tea.”
(23b) 
  Ξέρω ένα καινούριο γαλλικό εστιατόριο. 
  “I know a new French restaurant.”
In Modern Greek sentences 23a and 23b sound much better than the following:
(24a) 
  Θέλω ένα ζεστό ωραίο τσάι. 
  “I want a hot nice tea.”
(24b) 
  Ξέρω ένα γαλλικό καινούριο εστιατόριο.
  “I know a French new restaurant.”
Check the following sentence:
(IX) Δεν μου αρέσει το κόκκινο αυτοκίνητο. Προτιμώ το μαύρο (-).
 “I don’t like the red car. I prefer the black one.”
In order to create such elliptical sentences in Modern Greek, you simply remove the noun 
(I mean you don’t need one to support the adjective).

--- Page 88 ---

Chapter 5 | Before the Noun: Adjectives and More
Page 79
Comparison
People often need to make comparisons. Someone may be taller or shorter than another 
person, cars may be faster or slower than other cars, prices may be higher or lower etc. 
This fact makes comparison one of the basic fields for absolute beginners. And here are 
the basics of comparison:
(X) O Πέτρος είναι πιο ψηλός από τον Κώστα.
 “Peter is taller than Kostas.”
In order to form the comparative (“taller than”), all you need is the comparative adverb πιο 
(“more”) before the adjective and the preposition από (in this case “than”) after it. Keep in 
mind that as an adverb, πιο is not affected by agreement rules. Great news, right? 
In order to form the superlative (“the tallest of”), all you have to do is add the definite 
article before the comparative πιο and some version of “all” after the preposition από (but 
this last part is not obligatory).
(XI) O Πέτρος είναι ο πιο ψηλός (από όλους).
 “Peter is the tallest (of all).”
What about sameness? Here is a typical sentence:
(XII) Ο Πέτρος είναι το ίδιο ψηλός με τον Κώστα.
 “Peter is as tall as Costas.”
Phone Numbers
Modern Greek people have a whim about phone numbers: Instead of spelling out each 
number separately, they usually join some of them in groups of two or three, following a 
metrical pattern. Thus a phone number like the following 
(XIII) 6978124715
could be 
(XIV) 6-9-78-124-7-15
or even
(XV) 6-97-8-12-47-15
These short poems are something you definitely must avoid if you want to get some-
one’s phone number correctly. You can stop her/him by saying something polite like                           
Ένα ένα, παρακαλώ, δεν μιλάω πολύ καλά ελληνικά ακόμα (“One by one, please, I don’t 
speak Modern Greek fluently yet”).

SUMMARY
Chapter 5 deals with noun-dependent words (such as articles, adjectives or numerals) that 
precede the noun providing extra information about it. As with nouns and verbs, the introduc-
tion of the above categories is again structured on the axis form/use, with a focus on agree -
ment, which shapes the form of these words in order to match the grammatical profile of the 
“head” noun. 
KEY WORDS
noun phrase, “head” noun, noun-dependent words, agreement, article, definite/indefinite, ge-
neric/specific, numeral, quantifier, adjective, modify/modifier

Chapter 6 | Instead of Nouns: Pronouns
Page 82
CHAPTER 6 | Instead of Nouns: Pronouns
Dictionaries and grammars are an absolute beginner’s best friend. Sometimes, though, they are 
simply not enough. I will start with the following sentence:
(1) Έχω έναν αδερφό, αλλά δεν τον βλέπω συχνά.
 “ Ι have a brother, but I don’t see him often. ”
In order to get the meaning of the word αδερφό you must use a dictionary and a grammar (see 
Unit 3.4 on page 47). You will find out there it is a form of the noun “brother”. In order to get 
the meaning of the word τον, you certainly need a grammar or a dictionary. You will find out 
there it means “him”. But this is not enough: In order to get the actual meaning of this word, 
you must look in the context. You will find out there that τον refers to the word αδερφό. 
Words like τον or him are typical pronouns. They always need a point of reference outside 
them in order for one to get their actual meaning. This point of reference may be inside the 
text like in sentence 1, or outside it. The blue “ I” in the second line of this page (no, it’s not a 
misprint) and the black “I” inside sentence 1 refer to two different persons: The first one is me, 
the second one is this hypothetical person who produced a statement such as 1.
Pronouns are used instead of nouns, either because there are no nouns for some things 
(which noun can replace “I”?) or because nouns sometimes are too much. Imagine what life 
would be like if there were no pronouns to help. We would have to repeat the same noun again 
and again: “I have a dog. I love the dog very much. I take the dog out every day…”
Let’s turn now to Modern Greek pronouns, and check the following examples:
(2a) Έχω έναν αδερφό, αλλά δεν τον βλέπω συχνά.
 “I have a brother, but I don’t see him often.”
(2b) Έχω μια αδερφή, αλλά δεν την βλέπω συχνά.
 “I have a sister, but I don’t see her often.”
Pronouns are noun-dependent words in the sense that they need a noun as a reference point in 
order to reveal their actual meaning. In this respect they behave like noun-dependent words. 
First, they have gender, number and case (τον and την in the example are masculine accusative 
singular and feminine accusative singular). Secondly, they must agree with the reference noun 
like ordinary adjectives (τον refers to a masculine noun; την refers to a feminine noun). 
Modern Greek pronouns usually extend their role as noun-dependent words to become real 

--- Page 92 ---

Chapter 6 | Instead of Nouns: Pronouns
Page 83
adjectives (compare to English, where there is significant difference between the pronominal 
and adjectival forms in examples like the following).  
(3a) Κάποιος χτυπάει το κουδούνι.
 “ Someone is ringing the bell.”
(3b) Κάποιος γείτονας χτυπάει το κουδούνι.
 “ Some neighbour / A neighbour is ringing the bell.”
In the following units I will introduce basic groups of Modern Greek pronouns. Sometimes it is 
hard to follow the terminology, so I will make life easier with an English example in each title.
6.1 Personal Pronouns (I, you)
Personal pronouns are structured in the first, second and third person to form the following 
group:
1st 2nd 3rd
SINGULAR
NOM. εγώ εσύ αυτός / αυτή / αυτό
ACC. • με
• εμένα
• σε
• εσένα
• τον / την / το
• αυτόν / αυτήν / αυτό
PLURAL
NOM. εμείς εσείς αυτοί /αυτές / αυτά
ACC. • μας
• εμάς
• σας
• εσάς
• τους / τις / τα
• αυτούς / αυτές / αυτά
Table 6.1: The Personal Pronouns (Nominative and Accusative).

--- Page 93 ---

Chapter 6 | Instead of Nouns: Pronouns
Page 84
• Unlike the third person, the first and second persons cannot be assigned a gender. In 
other words, εγώ or εσύ are gender-free pronouns.  
• Some forms of the third person are taken from the demonstrative pronoun (see Unit 6.2 
on page 85). In this respect, there is not a genuine he/she/it in Modern Greek, but 
rather this one (masculine, feminine or neuter).
• Check the third person and focus on the accusative forms τον/την/το, τους/τις/τα. Do 
they look familiar? The answer is yes. They are identical to the definite article in the 
accusative. It looks like someone has erased the noun (to avoid repetition) and kept the 
article to establish a connection with the reference point. 
• Remember that the use of such pronouns in the subject position is optional (see Unit 
2.2.1 on page 26).
Modern Greek personal pronouns have two forms for the accusative. One is short, while the 
other one is longer (compare σε to εσένα). The use of each pronoun is not random but depends 
on syntax:
 (4a) Σε αγαπάω πολύ.
 “I love you very much.”
(4b) Αυτό το δώρο είναι για (ε)σένα.
 “This present is for you.”
I believe it is clear that the short form is used in the object position and the long form is used 
inside a prepositional phrase (but there is much more to be said at Levels B1-B2).
Sequences of vowels (either inside words or across word boundaries) are not always wel-
come in Modern Greek. This is why the word-initial (and unstressed) vowel of some per -
sonal pronouns is usually dropped after a word-final (and stressed) vowel (από σένα).
Unlike English (and very much like Spanish or French), Modern Greek personal pronouns in 
the accusative must be positioned right before the verb. But which part of the verb?
(5a) Σε θέλω.
 “I want you.”
(5b) Δεν σε θέλω.
 “I don’t want you.”

--- Page 94 ---

Chapter 6 | Instead of Nouns: Pronouns
Page 85
Pronouns are placed right before the “real” verb, this part of the verbal construction that bears 
grammatical information. The negation particle δεν does not have such grammar inside it, so 
the pronoun goes right before θέλω.
Note that the accusative of personal pronouns replaces basically definite expressions. In-
definite expressions cannot be replaced by personal pronouns:
(Ia) Α: Θέλεις τον καφέ σου; Β: Ναι, τον θέλω.
(Ib) A: Θέλεις καφέ;  Β: Ναι, (-) θέλω.
Likes and Dislikes
In Modern Greek, coffee is not something you may or may not like, but rather something 
that pleases (or doesn’t please) you. Check the following sentences:
(ΙΙa) Mου αρέσει ο καφές. 
 “Ι like coffee.”
(ΙΙb) Μου αρέσουν οι μπανάνες. 
 “I like bananas.”
The subject of the verb is clearly coffee or bananas (this is why their case is nominative 
and this is why the verb turns from singular to plural).
The person who likes something is represented by this short word preceding the verb. 
(IΙIa) Μου αρέσει ο καφές.
 “ I like coffee.”
(IIΙb) Του / Tης αρέσει ο καφές.
 “ He/She likes coffee.”
These short words belong to another group of personal pronouns, about which you will 
learn more at levels B1-B2. For the moment you need to know these forms only to express 
likes and dislikes (a very basic need after all): μου (1st, sing.) σου (2nd, sing.), του/της/του 
(3rd, sing.), μας (1st, pl.), σας (2nd, pl.), τους (3rd, pl.).
And don’t forget: The subject of αρέσει must be preceded by the definite article (see 
Unit 5.2 on page 70).
6.2 Demonstrative Pronouns (this, that)
Modern Greek has two demonstrative pronouns for short (“here”) and long (“there”) distance 
respectively: αυτός (“this”) and εκείνος (“that”). Both are formed like ordinary adjectives (but

Table 6.3: The Demonstrative Pronoun εκείνος (Nominative and Accusative).
The demonstrative αυτός (but also εκείνος) are basically used like personal pronouns of the 
third person, whenever necessary (remember that in subject position they are optional). 
(6) Αυτός θέλει παγωτό, εκείνος θέλει μπίρα.
 “ This one wants ice cream, that one wants beer.” 
Both pronouns can also be used like adjectives, with an obligatory definite article (see Unit 5.2 
on page 70) and no considerable change in meaning:
(7a) Θέλω αυτόν τον αναπτήρα.
 “I want this lighter.”
(7b) Θέλω εκείνο τον αναπτήρα.
 “I want that lighter.”

(7c) Θέλω αυτόν τον ακριβό αναπτήρα.
 “I want this expensive lighter.”
6.3 Interrogative Pronouns (who?, what?)
There are three basic interrogative pronouns, one for persons (ποιος, “who”), one for things (τι, 
“what”), and one for quantification (πόσος, for its meaning see bellow).
(8a) Ποιος θέλει παγωτό;
 “ Who wants ice cream?”
(8b) Τι θέλεις;
 “ What do you want?”
Ποιος goes like an ordinary adjective (but notice the final -ν in ποιον):

PLURAL
NOM. ποιοι ποιες ποια
ACC. ποιους ποιες ποια
Table 6.4: The Interrogative Pronoun ποιος (Nominative and Accusative).
Unlike ποιος, τι has the same form everywhere, so no need for another table. 
All these vowels and no accent mark. Why? Check the pronounciation of any form of 
ποιος. What you really hear is only one syllable (see Unit 1.6.2 on page 13). This is why 
the accent mark is absent.
The interrogative pronoun that focuses on quantification is πόσος, -η, -ο (for its endings see 
Table 5.7). In the singular it is equal to “how much” (Πόση ζάχαρη θέλεις;= “How much sugar 
do you need?”). In the plural it is equal to “how many” (Πόσες μπανάνες θέλεις;= “How many 
bananas do you need?”).

--- Page 97 ---

Chapter 6 | Instead of Nouns: Pronouns
Page 88
Note that in questions involving a preposition, the preposition comes first and the pronoun 
comes second (compare to English):
(ΙVa) Για ποιον είναι το δώρο;
 “ Who is the present for?”
(IVb) Για τι μιλάς;
 “ What are you talking about?
Suppose now that someone knocks on the door. What I will say is Ποιος είναι; and not 
Ποια είναι; If I am talking to a group of 10 females and 1 male, what I will ask is again 
Ποιος θέλει καφέ; and not Ποια θέλει καφέ; Obviously the masculine prevails in grammar. 
But grammar is different from life anyway.
Interrogative pronouns are also used like ordinary adjectives. Check the following sentences:
(9a) Ποιο βιβλίο προτιμάς;
 “ Which book do you prefer?”
(9b) Tι βιβλίο προτιμάς;
 “ What sort of book do you prefer?”
Now the difference between person-reference ( ποιος) and thing-reference ( τι) is gone. But 
there is still some considerable difference of meaning between the two.
Considering that asking questions is important for everyday life, let me give you a list with 
the basic interrogative words:
ποιος “who”
τι “what”
πότε / κάθε πότε “when” / “how often”
πού “where”
πώς “how”
πόσο “how much”
γιατί “why”
Table 6.5: Basic Interrogative Words.

Page 89
6.4 Indefinite Pronouns (someone, anyone)
The basic indefinite pronouns are κάποιος (“someone”) / κάτι (“something”) and κανένας (“an-
yone”) / τίποτα (“anything”). Κάποιος and κανένας refer to persons, while κάτι and τίποτα refer 
to things. 
A few words now about their form: Κάποιος and κάτι are compound words, consisting of 
κα- (some-) and - ποιος or - τι. Therefore you can go back to Table 6.4 on page 87 and form 
the pronoun κάποιος by yourselves (don’t forget the form κάποιον). Κάτι has the same form 
everywhere, so it should be a piece of cake for you.
Κανένας is again a compound word, consisting of καν- (any-) plus the indefinite article. Go 
back to Table 5.2 on page 68 and you can form the entire pronoun by yourselves (remember, 
it has no plural). Τίποτα keeps the same form everywhere, so it is as easy as κάτι. 
What is important here is not form, but use. The choice of indefinite pronouns depends on 
sentence type: Κάποιος / Kάτι are used in affirmative sentences, while κανένας / τίποτα are used 
in non-affirmative sentences (such as interrogative and negative sentences).
(10a) Βλέπω κάποιον / κάτι.
 “I see someone / something.”
(10b) Βλέπεις κανέναν / τίποτα;
 “ Do you see anyone / anything?”
(10c) Δεν βλέπω κανέναν / τίποτα. 
 “I don’t see anyone / anything.”
I believe that the analogy with English is clear. Kάποιος is someone, and κανένας is anyone. 
What about no one? No one (and other related words like nowhere) simply do not exist in Mod-
ern Greek. In negative sentences κανένας always needs external negation (such as δεν) to exist, 
so it has no internal negative meaning like no one. So, in order to say “I see no one” in Modern 
Greek, you must again say “I don’t see anyone”.  
What about elliptical sentences like the following?
(V) Α: Τι θέλεις;
 Β: Τίποτα. 
The negation particle is not present but still presumed, so again the indefinite τίποτα is 
anything, not nothing.
Indefinite pronouns are also used like adjectives, with no change in form and no considerable 

--- Page 99 ---

Chapter 6 | Instead of Nouns: Pronouns
Page 90
change in meaning. Here again indefinite adjectives are related to sentence type like before.
(11a) Περιμένω κάποιον. / Περιμένω κάποιον πελάτη.
 “Ι am waiting for someone.” / “I am waiting for a customer.”
(11b) Περιμένεις κανέναν; / Περιμένεις κανέναν πελάτη;
 “Are you waiting for anyone?” / “Are you waiting for any customer?”
(11c) Δεν περιμένω κανέναν. / Δεν περιμένω κανέναν πελάτη.
 “I am not waiting for anyone.” / “I am not waiting for any customer.”
Κάποιος / κανένας and ένας
Indefinite pronouns share the same area as the indefinite article. The issue is rather compli-
cated, so I will save your time and my energy with the following points:
• In interrogative and negative sentences, the indefinite κανένας stands alone; I mean it 
cannot be replaced by the indefinite ένας. In a sentence like Δεν περιμένω έναν πελάτη 
αλλά δύο, the indefinite article should be taken as a numeral, because the meaning is “I 
am not waiting for one customer but two”.
• In affirmative sentences the indefinite ένας and the indefinite κάποιος in principle can 
replace each other, like here: Περιμένω έναν πελάτη / Περιμένω κάποιον πελάτη.
Let me now give you some basic indefinite words from both sides:
κάποιος “someone” κανένας “anyone”
κάτι “something” τίποτα “anything”
κάπου “somewhere” πουθενά “anywhere”
κάποτε “some time” ποτέ “ever”
κάπως “somehow”, “some way”
καθόλου “any” (quantity)
Table 6.6: Basic Indefinite Words.
6.5 Relative Pronouns (who, which, where)
Relative pronouns are both good and bad news for absolute beginners. But let me start with the 
bad news. Check the following sentences:

--- Page 100 ---

Chapter 6 | Instead of Nouns: Pronouns
Page 91
(12a) Ποιος μένει με τον Πέτρο;
 “ Who lives with Peter?”
(12b) Αυτός είναι ο φοιτητής που μένει με τον Πέτρο.
 “This is the student who lives with Peter.”
Relative pronouns in Modern Greek are not identical to interrogative pronouns (compare to 
English). So you cannot go back to Unit 6.3 on page 87 and get some help. In fact, Modern 
Greek has a wide range of relative pronouns, but (this is where the good news starts) for levels 
A1-A2 only one is necessary: που. 
Που is a general relative pronoun (it corresponds to who, that, which, where), and an oblig-
atory part of every relative clause (compare to English):
(13) Να ο χάρτης που θέλω.
 “Here is the map (-) / that / which I want.”
More good news now: Που is not inflected, so it stays the same everywhere, regardless of 
gender (14a), number (14b) or case (14c) and regardless of its syntactic role inside the relative 
clause (14d): 
(14a) Να ο χάρτης που θέλω. / Nα η ομπρέλα που θέλω.
 “Here is the map I want.” / “Here is the umbrella I want.”
(14b) Nα o χάρτης που θέλω. / Να οι χάρτες που θέλω.
 “Here is the map I want.” / “Here are the maps I want.” 
(14c) Nα ο χάρτης που θέλω. / Θέλω τον χάρτη που έχεις.
 “Here is the map I want.” / “I want the map you have.”
(14d) Θέλω τον χάρτη που (ΟΒJ.) έχεις. / Θέλω τον χάρτη που (SUB.) είναι στο τραπέζι.
 “Ι want the map you have.” / “I want the map which is on the table.”
Note that when που is equal to where it can be replaced by the relative adverb όπου.
(15) Να το σπίτι που / όπου μένω.
 “Here is the house where I live.”
The interrogative πού bears an accent mark in order to look different in writing from the 
relative που.

6.6 Where Are the Possessive Pronouns (my, your)?
Unlike the pronouns from Units 6.1-6.5, possessive pronouns do not appear on the left side of 
the “head” noun, but on its right:
(16) το σπίτι μου
 “ my house”
Considering that words positioned after the noun differ in several important respects from 
words that come before the noun, possessive pronouns are examined in Chapter 10, along with 
relevant structures. Nevertheless, you can go to Unit 10.2.3 on page 144 and study these pro-
nouns right now.

--- Page 102 ---

Chapter 6 | Instead of Nouns: Pronouns
Page 93
Being polite
Let’s start with the following scenario: You are waiting for the bus. Someone next to you 
is carrying some books which are too heavy for her/him while at the same time trying to 
find her/his ticket. If you offer to help, you might say “Do you need help?” or something 
like that. 
In Modern Greek your offer for help would depend on the person you are addressing. If 
this person is someone familiar to you (such as a friend of yours or your grandfather) or any 
unknown person of your age, what you would say is this:
(VI) Θέλεις βοήθεια;
If this person is an elderly unknown person, or a “status person” (such as your professor), 
what you would say instead is this: 
(VII) Θέλετε βοήθεια;
In this context θέλετε is not used as a real plural. It is used as a singular, to show respect. 
So, apart from its ordinary meaning, the second person plural (εσείς) may be used instead 
of the second person singular (εσύ) in order to express politeness. In this sense, Modern 
Greek is very close to French and less close to German or Spanish (both languages use the 
third person for politeness). 
Like elsewhere, what was said here is meant to develop your politeness awareness and help 
you avoid misunderstandings in everyday situations (if you are addressed as εσείς, don’t 
look around you. Perhaps the speaker only tried to be polite). It is obvious you are learning 
the language, and nobody expects you to be a master of politeness. So relax and keep in 
mind the following:
• The polite εσείς is only one of the means to express politeness. Politeness starts from 
topics of conversation (you cannot discuss personal matters with your professor) and 
single words like κύριος (“Sir”, “Mr”) for men and κυρία (“Madam”, “Ms”) for women. 
But even facial expressions and body language are involved. 
• Politeness is not a clear-cut area. There are several circumstances where people have to 
choose between the polite path and the familiar path, and sometimes the choice is not 
easy.
• In the Modern Greek culture, people tend to start with the polite way and shift quickly 
to the familiar way (usually the “status person” suggests the shift). Using the polite way 
in the beginning sounds OK, but insisting on it would mean that you want to remain 
distant, which does not sound OK at all.

SUMMARY
Pronouns are a special case of noun-dependent words, since they are related to a noun as a 
point of reference in order to get their actual meaning. In this sense they behave like other 
noun-dependent words regarding agreement. Chapter 6 introduces basic groups of Modern 
Greek pronouns. The focus this time is not on form (most pronouns are inflected like typical 
adjectives) but on use and meaning shifts between real pronouns and their use like adjectives.

Chapter 7 | About the Verb: Adverbials

CHAPTER 7 | About the Verb: Adverbials
Verbs in use do not usually appear by themselves to form sentences. They come together with 
other units, like in the following examples: 
(1a) Έρχεται την Tρίτη.
 “She/He is coming on Tuesday.”
(1b) Έρχεται στις εφτά.
 “She/He is coming at seven o’ clock.”
(1c) Έρχεται αύριο.
 “She/He is coming tomorrow.”
(1d) Έρχεται όταν φεύγω.
 “She/He comes when Ι leave.”
These units (called adverbials in grammar terminology) have a lot in common: Each one of 
them depends on a verb, the latter being either explicit or implicit. Each one of them provides 
extra information about the action described by this verb (time, in our example). In this respect 
the relationship between an adverbial and its “head” verb is not radically different from the one 
between an adjective and its “head” noun (see Chapter 5 on page 66).
Two points now about adverbials in general:
• Adverbials modify the meaning of the verb, organizing it along semantic categories such 
as the following: 
(2a) Έρχεται αύριο.  (TIME)
 “She/He is coming tomorrow.”
(2b) Έρχεται κάθε μέρα.  (FREQUENCY)
 “She/He comes every day.”
(2c) Έρχεται σπίτι.   (PLACE-DESTINATION)
 “She/He is coming home.”
(2d) Έρχεται από το σχολείο. (PLACE-ORIGIN)
 “She/He is coming from school.”

--- Page 105 ---

Chapter 7 | About the Verb: Adverbials
Page 96
(2e) Έρχεται με το λεωφορείο. (MEANS)
 “She/He is coming by bus.”
(2f) Έρχεται γιατί πεινάει. (CAUSE/REASON)
 “She/He is coming because she/he is hungry.”
• Each one of these semantic categories unites adverbials from different formal categories. 
For example, time in Modern Greek may be expressed by the single accusative (1a), a prep-
ositional phrase (1b), an adverb (1c) or an adverbial clause (1d).
In the following units I will present the major formal categories of adverbials in Modern Greek. 
Assuming that you are well aware of semantic categories either from your mother tongue or 
from English, I will focus on the peculiarities of the Modern Greek adverbial system. 
7.1 Prepositions
Let’s start with an elementary scenario: Someone has asked me if I use my car to go to work, 
and I want to say that I use my feet instead. What I would say in English, French and Modern 
Greek would go like this:
(3a) I go on foot.  (MEANS-ENGLISH)
(3b) Je vais à pied.  (MEANS-FRENCH)
(3c) Πάω με τα πόδια. (MEANS-MODERN GREEK)
As you see, the same semantic category (MEANS) may be expressed by a different preposi -
tion across three different languages. This is a fact that makes prepositions one of the hardest 
aspects of language learning. Having these in mind, let’s turn to the wild world of prepositions 
in Modern Greek and try to put the chaos in some sort of order.
7.1.1 Simple Prepositions
Simple prepositions are ordinary prepositions like the ones you have already encountered in 
Chapters 2 on page 25, 3 on page 35, and 6 on page 84: 
(4a) O Γιάννης μένει με τον Πέτρο.
 “John lives with Peter.”
(4b) Aυτό το δώρο είναι για (ε)σένα.
 “This present is for you.”

--- Page 106 ---

Chapter 7 | About the Verb: Adverbials
Page 97
For levels A1-A2 you need to handle four basic prepositions, namely σε, από, με, and για. These 
prepositions are used in a great variety of contexts, representing multiple semantic categories:
(5a) Μένω με τον Πέτρο.  (INVOLVEMENT)
 “I live with Peter.”
(5b) Πάω με το λεωφορείο. (MEANS)
 “I go by bus.”
(5c) Πλένω τα πιάτα με προσοχή. (MANNER)
 “I wash the dishes with care.”
In the following units I will try to provide a comprehensive account of Modern Greek preposi-
tions, explaining how these semantic categories are interrelated. If you think the analysis is too 
much for you, you can always skip it and check the examples in order to track similarities and 
dissimilarities with your mother tongue. 
• The preposition σε
The preposition σε is perhaps the most important of all four prepositions because of its high 
incidence and multiple uses. But let me first make sure you can see it in the following example: 
(6) Ο Πέτρος είναι στην (σ[ε]+την) Αθήνα.
 “Peter is in Athens”.
The preposition σε merges with the definite article, losing its vowel. The initial σ- here repre-
sents what is left of the preposition, as a result of this process. 
The preposition σε merges only with the definite article. It does not merge with other 
words, like the indefinite article: 
(I) Πάω σε μια φίλη μου.
 “I am going to a friend of mine.”
Having clarified this issue, let’s now turn to issues of meaning: The preposition σε is strongly 
related to the semantic category of place, indicating the point where an action is performed 
(location):
(7) Κολυμπάει στην πισίνα.
 “She/He is swimming in the pool.”

--- Page 107 ---

Chapter 7 | About the Verb: Adverbials
Page 98
Swimming in the pool starts and ends within the limits of the pool. Like the English in, the 
Modern Greek σε indicates that the action is completed at a specific location and does not ex -
tend elsewhere. But σε does not only equal in. Check the following sentences: 
(8a) Το βιβλίο είναι στο τραπέζι.
 “Τhe book is on the table.”
(8b) Το πουλί είναι στο κλουβί. 
 “The bird is in the cage.”
I believe it is clear that the context radically impacts the actual reading of σε: The form of a 
table (8a) differs considerably from the form of a cage (8b), and this difference easily turns σε 
from in to on. 
For similar reasons σε may be equivalent to the preposition at. Check the following sentences:
(9a) Eίμαστε στην Αθήνα.
 “We are in Athens.”
(9b) Eίμαστε στο σχολείο.
 “We are at school.”
Let me now replace the verb είμαι with a motion verb like πάω:
(10) Πάμε στην Αθήνα.
 “ We are going to Athens”.
Σε this time is related to destination, not location like in examples 7-9. But the pattern is not 
really different. The motion described by πάμε will necessarily be completed in Athens and 
cannot extend elsewhere.
Buses and Drivers
The sense of destination (as in 10) is not part of the meaning of σε, but rather results from 
a clear motion verb like πάω. To put it simply: σε cannot be to if there is no such verb to 
help. Here are two examples:
• The “bus to Athens” is not Το λεωφορείο στην Αθήνα but Το λεωφορείο για την Αθήνα. 
• What if I want to say “I drive to Athens”? No, it’s not Οδηγώ στην Αθήνα. This means 
that you drive inside Athens. What people say is: Πάω με το αυτοκίνητο στην Αθήνα.

--- Page 108 ---

Chapter 7 | About the Verb: Adverbials
Page 99
A similar pattern can be found outside the semantic category of place, where σε introduces the 
(indirect) object of the verb: 
(11a) O Κώστας μιλάει στον Πέτρο.
 “Kostas is talking to Peter”.
(11b) Η Ελένη γράφει ένα μέιλ στην Κατερίνα.
 “Helen is writing an e-mail to Catherine.”
What we have here is another version of destination. Kostas and Helen are engaged in an action 
(speaking, writing), which is directed to Peter and Catherine respectively. 
The preposition σε (along with the definite article) may be omitted in several contexts: 
(IIa) Πάει στο σχολείο.
 “She/He is going to the school.”
(IIb) Πάει (-) σχολείο.
 “She/He is going to (-) school.”
The two sentences differ in a way similar to their English equivalents: Motion is prominent 
in IIa, where πάω behaves like a typical motion verb. Motion is less prominent, if not total-
ly gone, in IIb. Here πάω is part of a periphrasis, whose meaning is not related to motion 
at all. The latter sentence basically means “She/He is a pupil”.
Unlike its English equivalents, the preposition σε is basically related to place, not time. Time in 
Modern Greek is expressed by the single accusative (see Unit 3.2.5 on page 42) or another 
preposition (check 12c):
(12a) Δεν έχουμε σχολείο (-) την Τετάρτη.
 “We do not have school on Wednesday.”
(12b) Δεν έχουμε σχολείο (-) τα Χριστούγεννα.
 “We do not go to school at Christmas.”
(12c) Τα σούπερ μάρκετ είναι ανοιχτά από τις εννιά μέχρι τις πέντε.
 “Super markets stay open from nine to five.” 
The only temporal uses of σε relate to clock time (13a) and quantificational time phrases (13b 
and 13c): 

--- Page 109 ---

Chapter 7 | About the Verb: Adverbials
Page 100
(13a) Το ραντεβού είναι στις πέντε.
 “The appointment is at five.”
(13b) Φεύγω σε πέντε λεπτά.
 “I am leaving in five minutes.”
(13c) Έρχομαι σε λίγο.
 “I am coming in a while.”
• Τhe preposition από
Like σε, the preposition από is related to place. Unlike σε, which indicates the place where an 
action is completed, από points to another place, where something started, to be completed 
elsewhere. Technically, από expresses the source, or origin, of an action: 
(14a) Έρχομαι από το σχολείο.
 “I am coming from school.”
(14b) Eίμαι από την Ιταλία.
 “I am from Italy.”
Beyond place, the pattern of source applies to causal relations. Here, από again indicates a 
starting point, the cause, which leads to an effect: 
(15a) Κλαίω από χαρά.
 “I’m crying for/out of joy.”
(15b) Πέθανε από έμφραγμα.
 “She/He died of a heart attack.”
The same pattern can be found in comparison: 
(16a) Ο Γιάννης είναι πιο ψηλός από τον Πέτρο.
 “John is taller than Peter.”
(16b) Ο Γιάννης είναι ο πιο ψηλός από όλους.
 “John is the tallest of all”.
Comparison involves a point of departure. There is Peter (16a), whom I take as a starting point 
in order to claim that John is taller. The same holds for the superlative, like in 16b.

--- Page 110 ---

Chapter 7 | About the Verb: Adverbials
Page 101
Compared to σε, the preposition από is easier in terms of time. Here again it is related to the 
semantic category of source, indicating a point of temporal departure: 
(17a) Τα σούπερ μάρκετ είναι ανοιχτά από τις εννιά μέχρι τις πέντε.
 “Super markets stay open from nine to five.”
(17b) Περιμένω από το πρωί. 
 “I’ve been waiting since morning.”
• Τhe preposition με 
The preposition με is not directly related to place. It indicates that an action involves two par -
ticipants, like in the following sentence: 
(18) O Γιάννης μένει με τον Πέτρο.
 “John lives with Peter.”
Involvement, as in 18, easily turns into combination like in the following sentences:
(19a) Πίνει καφέ με γάλα.
 “She/He has coffee with milk.”
(19b) Ψάχνουμε έναν άντρα με πράσινα μάτια.
 “We are looking for a man with green eyes.”
Let’s return now to clear involvement (like in 18) and compare the following sentences: 
(20a) O Γιάννης διαβάζει με τον φίλο του, τον Πέτρο.
 “John is studying with his friend, Peter.”
(20b) O Γιάννης διαβάζει με την μαμά του.
 “John is studying with his mother.”
In 20a John is studying, and so is Peter. What about sentence 20b? The mother is not study -
ing, I believe. She is sitting with John to help him study. It seems that in this case one of the 
participants (the mother) becomes a condition for the performance of the action by the other 
participant (John). Perhaps John wouldn’t study if the mother were not there, either to assist 
him or just to make sure he stays away from his computer. 
This sense of condition becomes stronger in the following cases: 

--- Page 111 ---

Chapter 7 | About the Verb: Adverbials
Page 102
(21a) Ο Πέτρος κόβει το ψωμί με το μαχαίρι.  (INSTRUMENT)
 “Peter is slicing the bread with the knife.”
(21b) Ο Γιάννης πάει στο γραφείο με το λεωφορείο. (MEANS)
 “Peter goes to the office by bus.”
(21c) Ο Πέτρος πλένει τα πιάτα με προσοχή.  (MANNER)
 “Peter is washing the dishes with care.”
As the mother is helping her son do his study (20b), so is the knife helping Peter to slice the 
bread (21a). Equally, the bus offers John easy access to the office (21b). Finally, care becomes 
a specific condition (or should I say circumstance?) under which Peter is washing the dishes 
(21c). 
• The preposition για
The preposition για is the last (but not least) preposition of this group. Let’s start with the fol -
lowing examples:
(22a) Πάμε στο καφέ.
 “We are going to the cafe.”
(22b) Πάμε για καφέ. 
 “We are going for a coffee.”
The preposition σε indicates destination, a goal to be reached by motion. The preposition για 
indicates purpose, a goal to be achieved by action. This is the foundation for several basic ex -
pressions of everyday life: 
(23a) Πάμε για μπάνιο.
 “We go (-) swimming.”
(23b) Πάμε για φαγητό.
 “We go for lunch/dinner.”
(23c) Θέλω μια ομπρέλα για την παραλία.
 “I need an umbrella for the beach.”
The semantic category of purpose has a clearly subjective status. It focuses on the intentions of 
the speaker, which will be achieved through action. The action then may apply only to satisfy 

--- Page 112 ---

Chapter 7 | About the Verb: Adverbials
Page 103
these intentions: 
(24a) Αυτό το μπλουζάκι είναι πολύ στενό για μένα.
 “Τhis t-shirt is too tight for me.”
(24b) Για τον Πέτρο, αυτό το εστιατόριο είναι ακριβό. 
 “ According to Peter / In Peter’s opinion, this restaurant is expensive.”
The t-shirt in 24a is not too tight for everyone. It is too tight as far as I am concerned. And the 
statement that the restaurant is expensive (24b) is true only if we adopt Peter’s point of view. 
In these cases the preposition για introduces a point of reference, which takes a different inter-
pretation in sentences like the following:
(25) Μιλάω για τον Πέτρο.
 “I am talking about Peter.”
Here the point of reference, aided by a speech-related verb, transforms into the topic of con -
versation. 
The purpose of an action may also be seen as an explanation for performing this action: If 
I go for a coffee, then I go because I need a coffee. In the following sentences για introduces 
such an explanation, indicating the reason for the action:
(26a) Aυτό το εστιατόριο είναι διάσημο για τα γλυκά του.
 “This restaurant is famous for its desserts.”
(26b) Συγχαρητήρια για το τεστ!
 “Congratulations on the test!”
7.1.2 Complex Prepositions
A complex preposition typically consists of an adverb (usually locative but also temporal) fol-
lowed by a (simple) preposition: 
(27a) Tο σπίτι μου είναι κοντά στο σχολείο.
 “My house is near (-) the school.”
(27b) Tο σπίτι μου είναι μακριά από το σχολείο.
 “My house is far from school.”
In the above sentences the complex prepositions establish a locative relation among two enti -
ties represented by the nouns of the sentence. Σπίτι is positioned in space according to a refer-

--- Page 113 ---

Chapter 7 | About the Verb: Adverbials
Page 104
ence point, σχολείο, represented by the noun of the prepositional phrase.
The reference point of a locative relation may be explicit or implicit in a sentence:
(IIIa) To σπίτι μου είναι κοντά στο σχολείο.
 “My house is near the school.”
(IIIb) Tο σπίτι μου είναι κοντά (-).
 “My house is nearby.”
In cases of an implicit reference point, all you have to do in Modern Greek is keep the 
adverb and remove the (simple) preposition.
Here is a table with the basic complex prepositions according to the simple preposition they 
combine:
ΣΕ ΑΠΟ
μέσα (“in”, “inside”) έξω (“out”, “outside”)
κοντά / δίπλα (“near”, “by”, “next to”) μακριά (“far”, “away”)
πάνω (“on”) κάτω (“under”)
πίσω (“behind”)
αριστερά (“left”)
δεξιά (“right”)
γύρω (“around”)
μπροστά (“in front”)
απέναντι (“opposite”)
Table 7.1: Complex Prepositions of Place.
Complex prepositions may include only two simple prepositions: σε or από. The choice of σε 
or από is not random, but follows a pattern. Σε is used when the locative relation is based on 
contact. Let’s see how this goes: 
(28a) To πουλί είναι μέσα στο κλουβί.
 “The bird is inside the cage.”
(28b) Το βιβλίο είναι πάνω στο τραπέζι.
 “The book is on the table.”
(28c) To σπίτι είναι κοντά στο σχολείο.
 “The house is near the school.”

--- Page 114 ---

Chapter 7 | About the Verb: Adverbials
Page 105
(28d) Το παιδί είναι μπροστά στο δέντρο.
 “The child is in front of the tree.”
The bird of 28a is included in the cage (absolute contact). The book of 28b is in necessary 
contact with the table by the law of gravity. The position of the house in 28c offers easy access 
to the school (potential contact). Finally, in order to claim that the child is in front of the tree 
(28d), I must be in eye contact with the child.
The preposition από in turn is used when the locative relation is based not on contact, but 
on absence of contact, realized as distance:
(29a) To πουλί είναι έξω από το κλουβί.
 “The bird is outside the cage.”
(29b) Το βιβλίο είναι κάτω από το τραπέζι.
 “The book is under the table.”
(29c) To σπίτι είναι μακριά από το σχολείο.
 “The house is far from school.”
(29d) Το παιδί είναι πίσω από το δέντρο.
 “The child is behind the tree.”
Now the bird of 29a is excluded from the cage. The book of 29b may be lying on the floor, far 
away from the table. The house of 29c does not offer easy access to the school. And in order to 
claim that the child is behind the tree (29d), the tree must hide the child from my perspective. 
Let’s now focus on sentence 29c. What if the book is not on the table (contact) but over/
above the table (absence of contact)? Αll you have to do is keep the locative adverb and change 
the simple preposition: 
(30a) Tο βιβλίο είναι πάνω στο τραπέζι.
 “The book is on the table.”
(30b) Tο βιβλίο είναι πάνω από το τραπέζι.
 “The book is over/above the table.” 
I believe it is evident that the choice of σε or από is not accidental. Each one of them is selected 
according to a pattern, which goes back to their core meaning as introduced in Unit 7.1.1 on 
page 96.
This fact explains why orientation adverbs utilize από and not σε. Orientation is a relative 

--- Page 115 ---

Chapter 7 | About the Verb: Adverbials
Page 106
notion. In order to claim that something is on the right or on the left, you must adopt a perspec-
tive. You need a starting point, and starting points are the specialty of από.
This fact also explains why some complex prepositions permit σε or από, without any con-
siderable change in meaning. Let’s take two persons sitting απέναντι. One of the possible sce-
narios is this: These persons are sitting on two sides of a table facing each other. This position 
involves contact (as in eye contact) and distance (the table stands between them) at the same 
time. This is the reason why both prepositions are permitted. The same holds for μπροστά. A 
child in front of the tree (like in 28d) may be seen the other way, like something separating the 
viewer from the tree (distance).
Let’s turn now to temporal complex prepositions. Here we have only two: πριν (“before”/ 
“ago”) and μετά (“after”/ “afterwards”). “Before” and “after” position events in time. They are 
relative notions, which need a point of reference. It is not surprising then that both combine 
with the preposition από:
(31a) Έρχεται πριν (από) το φαγητό.
 “She/He comes before lunch.”
(31b) Έρχεται μετά (από) το φαγητό.
 “She/He comes after lunch.”
Compared to complex prepositions of place, complex prepositions of time have some peculi -
arities. First, they can appear without a simple preposition (check the parentheses in 31a and 
31b). Secondly, they can be placed before or after the noun. And when they come after it, the 
simple preposition is gone:
(32a-b) Ήρθε πριν (από) τρεις μέρες. / Ήρθε τρεις μέρες πριν.
 “She/He came three days ago.”
Note that 32a and 32b refer to an implicit starting point in time, indicating the amount of time 
that separates the action from this point. 
Πριν and μετά may also be used like simple adverbs:
(33a) Ήρθε πριν.
 “She/He came earlier / before.”
(33b) Θα έρθει μετά.
 “She/ He will come later / afterwards.”

7.2 Adverbs
After our visit to the wilderness of prepositions, adverbs must seem like kindergarden stuff. 
Modern Greek adverbs (and this is true for other languages as well) hold no surprises for the 
absolute beginner. Unlike prepositions, adverbs have a very concrete meaning which controls 
their use. And, again unlike prepositions, adverbs are related only to certain semantic catego -
ries. Each category is represented by an interrogative and/or an indefinite version (see Tables 
6.5 on page 88 and 6.6 on page 90), as well as other adverbs, whose meaning has already 
been introduced:
INTERROGATIVE INDEFINITE OTHER
PLACE πού κάπου
πουθενά μακριά, κοντά...
TIME πότε κάποτε
ποτέ σήμερα, τώρα...
FREQUENCY κάθε πότε ποτέ συχνά...
QUANTITY πόσο καθόλου λίγο, πολύ...
MANNER πώς κάπως καλά...
Table 7.2: Basic Modern Greek Adverbs.
Adverbs are so easy to handle that analysis is really not necessary. What you must keep in mind 
are the following points:
• Modern Greek adverbs can occupy different positions within the sentence. Therefore an 
English sentence like “She/He often watches TV” may have several versions in Modern 
Greek (check Unit 4.2 on page 61):
(34a) Βλέπει τηλεόραση συχνά.
(34b) Βλέπει συχνά τηλεόραση.
(34c) Συχνά βλέπει τηλεόραση.
In this respect adverbials in Modern Greek represent just another instance of free word order 
and focus-related phenomena (see Unit 1.7.3 on page 17).
Keep in mind, though, that interrogative adverbs usually come first in the sentence:
(35a) Πού είναι ο Πέτρος;
 “ Where is Peter? ”
(35b) Πότε φτάνει το τρένο;
 “ When does the train arrive?”

--- Page 117 ---

Chapter 7 | About the Verb: Adverbials
Page 108
• Adverbs of manner are directly related to their source adjectives, and this is a great help 
for you:
(36) εύκολος  → εύκολα
 “easy”  → “easily”
Remember the plural of the neuter (Table 5.8 on page 76)? This is your adverb. Take it and 
use it appropriately.
• Table 7.2 is not exhaustive in several respects. Some adverbs express possibility or proba-
bility like in the following examples:
(37a) Ίσως διαβάζει.
 “ Maybe she/he is studying.”
(37b) Μάλλον διαβάζει. 
 “She/He is probably studying.”
There are also adverbs that express certainty:
(38a-b) Βεβαίως διαβάζει. / Φυσικά διαβάζει.
 “ Of course she/he is studying.”
The Modern Greek adverbs ακριβά and ακριβώς look very much alike, but their mean -
ing is different. Ακριβά originates from the adjective ακριβός (“expensive”), and ακριβώς 
originates from the adjective ακριβής (“exact”, “accurate”, “punctual”). Don’t look for 
this adjective in your book, because its inflectional model is usually part of levels C1-C2.
7.3 Adverbial Clauses
Adverbial clauses depend on the main clause expressing semantic categories like the ones we 
examined in the previous units. For levels A1-A2 you must handle the basics of three catego -
ries.
• Let’s start with temporal clauses. The most elementary ones are those introduced with όταν 
(“when”). Όταν introduces an action that happens before or at the same time with the action 
described by the main clause.
(39a) Όταν γυρίζει σπίτι, βλέπει τηλεόραση.
 “ When she/he comes home, she/he watches TV .”

--- Page 118 ---

Chapter 7 | About the Verb: Adverbials
Page 109
(39b) Όταν τρώει βλέπει τηλεόραση.
 “ When she/he eats, she/he watches TV .”
• Clauses of cause/reason are introduced with γιατί or επειδή:
(40) Πάμε για μπάνιο γιατί / επειδή κάνει ζέστη.
 “We’re going swimming because it is hot.”
In sentences like 40 the two words are equivalent. There are though some differences between 
them (see Chapter 11 on page 151).
Γιατί is not only because. It is also why in questions, direct or indirect:
(IVa) Γιατί δεν κοιμάσαι;
 “ Why aren’t you sleeping?”
(IVb) Ρωτάει γιατί δεν κοιμάμαι.
 “She/He is asking why I am not sleeping.”
• Conditional clauses are introduced with αν (“if”).
(41) Αν πεινάω, τρώω μια μπανάνα.
 “ If I am hungry, I have a banana.”
The above example illustrates zero conditionals in Modern Greek, describing an action that 
repeats itself whenever the condition introduced by αν is present.
The landscape of conditionals is far more complex. Considering that at the moment you do 
not have the necessary grammatical means to explore it, conditionals that are related to futurity 
will be examined in Chapter 9 on page 136.

Buying χύμα 
Suppose you go to the supermarket to buy some φέτα cheese. You have two options. One is 
to go to the fridge and get packaged φέτα. The other option is to go to the section of cheese, 
and ask the employee to give you some φέτα. The employee will cut some φέτα from the 
barrel, wrap it and give it to you. This is an instance of buying χύμα.
Buying χύμα is the traditional method of buying goods, and reflects the world of small 
grocery shops, long before super markets became part of our life, back in the late 70’s. But 
even now people buy χύμα, basically cheese, salami or sausages, wine, coffee, beans or 
rice. Buying χύμα is usually cheaper. Buying χύμα may also be more interesting. A brand 
package of φέτα tastes more or less the same, while φέτα χύμα is less predictable, for better 
or for worse.
Buying χύμα has another story to tell. Originally a noun, the word χύμα survived up to 
now changing its grammatical status. But what is the actual grammatical status of χύμα? 
Is it an adverb (αγοράζω χύμα) or an adjective (θέλω φέτα χύμα)? Or perhaps both? Ask 
yourselves and then check your dictionary to find out. 
SUMMARY
Adverbials are units that depend on a “head” verb providing extra information about it. 
Chapter 7 introduces Modern Greek adverbials examining prepositions, adverbs and adver -
bial clauses. Considering that prepositions are one of the most problematic fields in language 
learning the greatest part of the chapter is dedicated to their use.

Chapter 8 | A Tense from the Past: The Modern Greek αόριστος
Page 113
CHAPTER 8 | A Tense from the Past: The Modern Greek αόριστος
The person behind this chapter is Pinelopi Michalakopoulou, 
who taught me how to teach the past back in the late 90’s.
People have a present, a past and (hopefully) a future. So do verbs. Tense, the instantiation of 
time in grammar, is perhaps the most important and easy to perceive feature of verbs. Tense 
shapes the verbal system across the arrow of time, and combines with other features (such as 
the aspect) to provide the actual tenses in most languages. 
Having dealt with the present (see Chapter 4 on page 51) it is now time to turn to the 
past, leaving the future for Chapter 9 on page 125. Modern Greek has several tenses related to 
the past. The leading part, though, is played by the tense called αόριστος, a tense which much 
resembles the English past simple in terms of use. 
As with the Modern Greek present tense, αόριστος is easy to use but not that easy to form. 
We shall then focus on matters of form and then proceed with matters of use. 
8.1 The Form of αόριστος
Like the Modern Greek present tense, αόριστος comes with good and bad news for absolute 
beginners. Let me start with the good news. Remember the multiple endings of verbs you 
had to learn for the present tense? There is no such thing here. Unlike the present, αόριστος 
comes with only one series of endings, suitable for all verbs. Here is the inflectional model for 
αόριστος: 
πάω → πήγα
SINGULAR
1st πήγα πήγα -α
2nd πήγες πήγες -ες
3rd πήγε πήγε -ε
PLURAL
1st πήγαμε πήγαμε -αμε
2nd πήγατε πήγατε -ατε
3rd πήγαν(ε) πήγαν(ε) -αν(ε)
Table 8.1: An inflectional Model for the Modern Greek αόριστος.
If you compare Table 8.1 to the tables of the present tense (see Unit 4.1 on page 52), it is a 
relief for students: Every Modern Greek verb will be like this. So all you have to do is memo-

--- Page 123 ---

Chapter 8 | A Tense from the Past: The Modern Greek αόριστος
Page 114
rize this table and go on. 
The previous model basically applies to “active” verbs. Most “passive” verbs follow a 
slightly different inflectional model, which is part of B1-B2 levels. “Passive” verbs then 
should not be your concern at the moment, but for practical reasons you need to know how 
the verb είμαι goes. Here it is! 
είμαι → ήμουν
SINGULAR
1st ήμουν(α)
2nd ήσουν(α)
3rd ήταν(ε)
PLURAL
1st ήμασταν / ήμαστε
2nd ήσασταν / ήσαστε
3rd ήταν(ε)
Table 8.2: The Verb είμαι in the Past.
Let’s go now to the bad news: The endings of the past may look OK, but the stem of the verbs 
does not. Let me give you an example:
(1) τρώω  → έφαγα
Τρώω represents one of the most extreme cases of irregularity: no absolute beginner would 
even guess that έφαγα is related to τρώω. And as a teacher, I have no rule to give you in order 
to help you relate the past to the present tense. This is an area where memory helps much more 
than reason. But irregularity is not the rule. Apart from irregular verbs, there are also regular 
verbs, and this is where reason replaces memory. Let me then introduce some order to chaos 
and give you a categorization frame for irregular and regular verbs in the past. 
8.1.1 Irregular Verbs (Group I)
Let me start with a list of some irregular verbs in the past. (If you need to check their meaning, 
go to the Appendix on page 162. The same holds for the next Tables.)

πίνω → ήπια
Table 8.3: Irregular Verbs in the Past (Group 1).
But where is the τρώω of our previous example? It is right below, in your second list of irreg-
ular verbs. 
8.1.2 More Irregular Verbs: A Stress Pattern for αόριστος
Here is another list of irregular verbs. As you see, τρώω is among them:
PRESENT PAST
ακούω → άκουσα
βάζω → έβαλα
δίνω → έδωσα
κάνω → έκανα
καταλαβαίνω → κατάλαβα
μένω → έμεινα
περιμένω → περίμενα
πλένω → έπλυνα
τρώω → έφαγα
Table 8.4: Irregular Verbs in the Past (Group 2).
I can almost hear your question: If the verbs of Group 2 (Table 8.4) are also irregular, why sep-
arate them from the irregular verbs of Group 1 (Table 8.3)? Compare two typical verbs from 
each group:

--- Page 125 ---

Chapter 8 | A Tense from the Past: The Modern Greek αόριστος
Page 116
(2)
Group 1 Group 2
πήρα κατάλαβα
πήρες κατάλαβες
πήρε κατάλαβε
πήραμε καταλάβαμε
πήρατε καταλάβατε
πήραν / πήρανε κατάλαβαν / καταλάβανε
What really makes the difference between the two verbs is the position of the stress. The 
forms of παίρνω keep the stress on the same syllable ( πη-). This is not the case for the verb 
καταλαβαίνω, where the stress may be on different syllables ( -τα- or -λα-). What lies behind 
this difference? The answer is this: unlike the verbs of Group 1, those of Group 2 follow a strict 
stress pattern. And the pattern goes like this:
(3)   • • •
   3 2 1
  κα- τά- λα- βα
 κα- τα- λά- βα- με
According to this pattern, a verb in the past must be stressed on the antepenultimate syllable 
(the third syllable from the end of the word). 
This pattern explains the “movement” of stress in the previous example. Notice that the 
length of the ending is crucial for the position of the stress: 
(4) κατάλαβαν καταλάβανε
This pattern also explains the development of an initial ε- in some verbs but not others. Com -
pare καταλαβαίνω with τρώω:
(5)
κατάλαβα έφαγα
κατάλαβες έφαγες
κατάλαβε έφαγε
καταλάβαμε φάγαμε
καταλάβατε φάγατε
κατάλαβαν / καταλάβανε έφαγαν/φάγανε

--- Page 126 ---

Chapter 8 | A Tense from the Past: The Modern Greek αόριστος
Page 117
The past stem of καταλαβαίνω (καταλαβ-) is lengthy, and therefore suitable to carry the stress 
on the third syllable. The past stem of τρώω (φαγ-) is too short for this pattern. It must then 
develop an initial ε-, which bears the stress:
(6) *φαγ-α  → έ-φαγ-α
Notice that whenever the verb is enough by itself to follow the pattern, the initial ε- is no longer 
necessary. 
(7) έφαγα  (-)φάγαμε
In the 1st person plural the ending has two syllables, and now the verb does not need a support 
vowel. 
Keep in mind that ε- develops only in order to bear the stress. In other words, you cannot 
have an unstressed ε-, only a stressed one (έ-).
The list of irregular verbs of Group 2 is not exhaustive. Here are some more irregular verbs 
you might need. (For more verbs go to the Appendix on page 162.)
PRESENT PAST
αρέσει → άρεσε
βγάζω → έβγαλα
θέλω → ήθελα
κλείνω → έκλεισα
ξέρω → ήξερα
πέφτω → έπεσα
στέλνω → έστειλα
φέρνω → έφερα
φεύγω → έφυγα
φτάνω → έφτασα
Table 8.5: Irregular Verbs in the Past (Group 2).
Notice that θέλω and ξέρω develop an initial ή- instead of έ-.
The trisyllabic stress pattern is the leading stress pattern for αόριστος. With the exception of 
the irregular verbs of Group 1 (in this respect, Group 1 is more irregular than Group 2), this 
pattern applies to every other irregular verb, but also to regular verbs as you will find out soon. 

--- Page 127 ---

Chapter 8 | A Tense from the Past: The Modern Greek αόριστος
Page 118
As a leading pattern it is essential for communication, which means that you must follow it in 
order to be understood. 
If you check the previous tables you will find out that some of the most basic verbs are 
irregular in the past tense. This is not a peculiarity of Modern Greek (compare to English, 
where the verbs to be and to go are also irregular, unlike verbs like to explode or to irri-
tate). For a plausible explanation press here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_and_ir-
regular_verbs .
8.1.3 Regular Verbs
Regular verbs in the past share two main features:
• They all follow the trisyllabic stress pattern. 
(8) κόβω  → έκοψα
 δ ουλεύω → δούλεψα
 τρέχω  → έτρεξα
• Their stem derives directly from the stem of the present tense with the addition of [s]. The 
forms έκοψα or έτρεξα in this respect is the output of a phonetic procedure which goes like 
this: 
(9) kov-o → e-kov-s-a → e-kops-a
 treh-o → e-treh-s-a → e-treks-a
The [s] of the past is common in both verbs. What makes the difference ([ps] vs. [ks]) is the 
final part of the present stem, which leads to a different result. Ι will spare you the technical 
explanation of the procedure to focus on the kind of reasoning you must follow with regular 
verbs. The verbs below represent a major group of regular verbs:
(10) κόβω  → έκοψα
 δουλεύω → δούλεψα
 γράφω  → έγραψα
Another group of regular verbs is represented by the following verbs:
(11) ανοίγω  → άνοιξα
 τ ρέχω  → έτρεξα
 φτιάχνω → έφτιαξα

--- Page 128 ---

Chapter 8 | A Tense from the Past: The Modern Greek αόριστος
Page 119
Can you now find out the past tense of the following verbs? Meaning is irrelevant at the mo -
ment, so your main concern is the form:
(12) ρίχνω  → ?
 σπρώχνω → ?
 χορεύω → ?
 κρύβω  → ?
What you must do is focus on the final part of the present stem: ρίχνω and σπρώχνω resemble 
φτιάχνω, so they their past is έριξα and έσπρωξα. Χορεύω resembles δουλεύω and therefore is 
δούλεψα. Finally, κρύβω is more like κόβω and its past must be έκρυψα. 
Here are some basic groups of regular verbs:
PRESENT PAST
γράφω → έγραψα
κόβω → έκοψα
δουλεύω → δούλεψα
ανοίγω → άνοιξα
τρέχω → έτρεξα
φτιάχνω → έφτιαξα
τελειώνω → τελείωσα
γυρίζω → γύρισα
Table 8.6: Regular Verbs in the Past (Group 3).
Apart from these clearly regular verbs, there are some less clear cases. Check the following 
verbs:
(13) αγοράζω → αγόρασα
 αλλάζω → άλλαξα
It might be helpful to know that a final -ζ- in the stem of the present turns into -σ- or -ξ- in the 
past, but you would still have to guess, and guessing is beyond the kind of reasoning you must 
develop with regular verbs. Until you go on with Modern Greek, I would advise you to treat 
such verbs as irregular verbs, and therefore memorize their past tense. 
The same holds for the following group:
(14) μιλάω  → μίλησα
 φοράω  → φόρεσα

--- Page 129 ---

Chapter 8 | A Tense from the Past: The Modern Greek αόριστος
Page 120
 γελάω  → γέλασα
 οδηγώ  → οδήγησα
 ζω  → έζησα
 μπορώ  → μπόρεσα
All verbs of groups B1 and B2 in the present tense (see Units 4.1.3 on page 56 and 4.1.4 on 
page 57) are predictable in the sense that they develop the same clear [s] in the past tense. 
What is not predictable is the vowel that develops before the [s]. For this reason I would advise 
you to treat them as irregular verbs, too.
The verb τηλεφωνώ looks like τελειώνω but it does not belong to the group represented 
by τελειώνω. Its stress falls on the final syllable. It must thus go like the verbs of B2 and 
become τηλεφώνησα. Don’t get confused with phonetic similarity; Stress is also very im-
portant.
The verb τελειώνω may have two phonetic versions:
(I) τε-λει-ώ-νω  τε-λειώ-νω
The two versions have a different syllabic structure, which leads to another result in the 
past:
(II) τε-λεί-ω-σα  τέ-λειω-σα
To summarize: Regular and irregular verbs in the past are structured on a scale of regularity, 
where regular verbs represent the top and irregular verbs of Group 1 represent the bottom.

8.2 The Use of αόριστος
The Modern Greek αόριστος is used to describe actions that took place before the moment of 
speaking. Therefore it typically combines with the following expressions:
• Adverbs related to the past:

--- Page 130 ---

Chapter 8 | A Tense from the Past: The Modern Greek αόριστος
Page 121
χτες “yesterday”
προχτές “the day before yesterday”
πέρσι “last year”
πρόπερσι “two years ago”
Table 8.8: Adverbs Related to the Past.
• Prepositional phrases introduced by πριν (see Unit 7.1.2 on page 106):
(15) Έφτασα πριν από τρεις μέρες. / Έφτασα τρεις μέρες πριν.
 “I arrived three days ago.”
• The single (non-prepositional) temporal accusative modified by the adjectives προηγούμενος 
(“preceding”) and περασμένος (“past”, “last”)
(16a) Tην περασμένη / προηγούμενη Τετάρτη πήγαμε στην Αθήνα.
 “We went to Athens last Wednesday.”
(16b) Τον περασμένο / προηγούμενο μήνα είδα τον Πέτρο δύο φορές.
 “I met Peter twice last month.”
The past tense is also compatible with time expressions that are typically related to the 
present (see Unit 4.2 on page 60):
(III) Σήμερα δεν πήγα σχολείο.
 “ Today I did not go to school.”
Like the present, the Modern Greek αόριστος needs no auxiliaries in order to form its interrog-
ative or negative versions. All you have to do with questions is change your intonation. And all 
you have to do with negative sentences is add the particle δεν before the verb.
(17a) Πήγε σχολείο.
 “She/He went to school.”
(17b) Πήγε σχολείο;
 “ Did she/he go to school?”
(17c) Δεν πήγε σχολείo.
 “She/He didn’t go to school.”

Celebrating the Past
The past is gone, but its memory is still with us to preserve it and sometimes to rewrite it 
through the lens of the present. As countries need national days to remind people of critical 
moments in their history, so do individuals need celebrations to remind them of critical 
moments in their life. And one of those critical moments is the day we came into being. 
Two generations ago, celebrating one’s γενέθλια (unlike its English equivalent the Mod-
ern Greek word for birthday is always in the plural) was rather rare. As members of a tra-
ditional society, people used to celebrate their name day instead. From the 70’s onwards, 
the society rapidly adopted a westernized way of life, and γενέθλια came to the foreground. 
Celebrating one’s name day (γιορτή) is still common, especially in the country, but γενέθλια 
is becoming more and more popular, especially among children or teenagers. 
The birthday ritual is no surprise for anyone familiar with the Western culture: There is 
a birthday cake (τούρτα [γενεθλίων]); people get presents, usually they go out with friends 
and/or the family, and they treat their guests (the verb is κερνάω and its past tense is κέρασα). 
What is different is the Modern Greek birthday song, which comes in two versions, one for 
females and one for males:
 Να ζήσεις, Δημήτρη,
 και χρόνια πολλά.
 Μεγάλος να γίνεις
 με άσπρα μαλλιά.
 Παντού να σκορπίζεις
 της γνώσης το φως,
 και όλοι να λένε
 να ένας σοφός!
 Να ζήσεις, Ελένη,
 και χρόνια πολλά.
 Μεγάλη να γίνεις
 με άσπρα μαλλιά.
 Παντού να σκορπίζεις
 της γνώσης το φως,
 και όλοι να λένε
 να μία σοφός!
SUMMARY
Chapter 8 introduces the Modern Greek αόριστος, the most basic of the tenses related to the 
past. The greatest part of the chapter is dedicated to the form of αόριστος, offering a compre-
hensive categorization frame for regular and irregular verbs in the past. The use of αόριστος 
is exemplified by typical adverbials related to the past.

EXERCISE
Here is a fairy tale you all know and can follow using a dictionary. The verbs in bold rep-
resent the three different groups of verbs regarding the past stem. What you must do is 
associate them with the verbs in the present and write their 1st person singular and plural 
in the past.

να δει τη γιαγιά της στο δάσος. 
Στο δρόμο την είδε ο Κακός Λύκος. «Τι ωραίο και παχουλό κοριτσάκι!» είπε μόνος του και

«ΚΟΚΚΙΝΟΣΚΟΥΦΙΤΣΑ!»
«Πού πας, Κοκκινοσκουφίτσα;»
«Πάω στη γιαγιά μου».
Ο Κακός Λύκος έφυγε γρήγορα και έφτασε πρώτος στο σπίτι της γιαγιάς. Έφαγε τη γιαγιά,

«Για να σε ακούω καλύτερα».
«Και γιατί έχεις τόσο μεγάλα δόντια;»
«Για να σε φάω καλύτερα!» είπε ο Λύκος και, χραπ!, έφαγε την Κοκκινοσκουφίτσα.
Τότε, ένας κυνηγός μπήκε στο σπίτι της γιαγιάς. Σκότωσε τον Κακό Λύκο και έσωσε την 
Κοκκινοσκουφίτσα και τη γιαγιά της. Μετά έκαναν ένα πάρτι που άρχισε το απόγευμα και

Page 125
CHAPTER 9 | To the Future: The Modern Greek μέλλοντας and More
Let’s start with the following scenario: Your roommate wants you to go to the super market. 
You hate going to the super market, and your roommate knows it. So she/he is trying to per -
suade you by saying:
(1) If you go...
 
(1a) …I will wash the dishes.
(1b) …I can wash the dishes.
(1c) …I am willing to wash the dishes.
(1d) …I promise to wash the dishes.
(1e) …I swear to wash the dishes.
Washing the dishes (1a-e) is an action belonging to the future, in the sense that it will be ful -
filled after the moment of speaking. This future action may be described by several means: by 
using the future simple (like in 1a) or an infinitive combined with the appropriate main verb 
(like in 1b-e). Infinitives originally refer to actions to be fulfilled at a time after the moment 
of speaking: If I promise to wash the dishes, then I am not washing the dishes now, but I will 
wash them later. 
Verbs used in the present or the past come with an air of certainty. If I refer to a past or a 
present action I seem to be describing a fact and thus my words can easily be verified or con -
tradicted. For example, if I say “It is raining” someone might open the window and check the 
truth of my statement. When it comes to the future, this air of certainty seems to fade. If I say 
“It is going to rain” nobody can check the truth of this statement and frankly nobody can be 
sure. A similar sense of uncertainty covers the area of intentions, volitions, obligations, abilities 
or possibilities, the typical area of the infinitive. Even if I swear to wash the dishes (like in 1e), 
nobody can be absolutely certain that I will keep my promise. In terms of meaning, then, infin-
itives share a common ground with future tenses, a fact that explains their formal resemblance 
in several languages. One of them is Modern Greek. 
9.1 Α Tense for the Future: the Modern Greek μέλλοντας
Modern Greek has several tenses related to the future, but the leading role is retained by the 
tense called (απλός) μέλλοντας, which is equivalent to the English future simple and the struc-
ture be going to. 
The Unit brings only good news for absolute beginners. There is nothing basic you don’t 

--- Page 135 ---

Chapter 9 | To the Future: The Modern Greek μέλλοντας and More
Page 126
know about the Modern Greek μέλλοντας. I just have to put things in order, add some details 
and let you enjoy the future.
9.1.1 The Form of μέλλοντας
Let me first give you some examples of verbs in the present, past, and future tenses:
(2) δουλεύω δούλεψα θα δουλέψω
 γ ράφω  έγραψα θα γράψω
Unlike the present and the past, the Modern Greek future is a periphrastic tense. In other words 
it is formed out of two components: the particle θα and the verbal form related to the future. Θα 
remains invariable through inflection, while the verbal form does not:
(3) θα δουλέψω  (“I will work”)
 θα δουλέψεις  (“you will work”)
 etc.
Θα is absolutely obligatory for the future. To put it differently: If you don’t have θα, then 
you have no future. People simply will not understand that you are referring to a future 
action.
Let’s focus on the verbal form. The stem of the future is based on the perfective stem (check 
Unit 2.2.2 on page 28). Do you know this stem? Partially, you do. The perfective stem is also 
the basis for the Modern Greek αόριστος. This is why the past and future tenses seem to have 
an affinity that the present does not share:
(4) δουλεύω δούλεψα θα δουλέψω
 γράφω  έγραψα θα γράψω
This affinity is a great help for you. It means that you can use the stem of the past tense in order 
to construct the perfective stem and then use it to make the future. All you have to do is take 
the stem of the past and remove any feature that is typical of the past:
• Remove the endings of the past:
(5) δούλεψ-  έγραψ-
• Remove the stress. Remember that the trisyllabic rule (see Unit 8.1.2 on page 115) is also 
typical of the past. Accordingly you should remove the initial έ- when present. What you 
see below in capital letters is the perfective stem of these verbs:

--- Page 136 ---

Chapter 9 | To the Future: The Modern Greek μέλλοντας and More
Page 127
(6) ΔΟΥ ΛΕΨ-  ΓΡΑΨ-
In order to get the future you must follow these steps:
• Add the particle θα
(7) θα δουλεψ-  θα γραψ-
• Restore the stress of the verb on its ordinary place, as it is in the present:
(8) θα δουλέψ-  θα γράψ-
• Αdd the endings of the future. These endings are not something new. They come directly 
from the present tense. Compare the following:
(9) δουλεύω θα δουλέψω   γράφω  θα γράψω
 δουλεύεις θα δουλέψεις   γράφεις θα γράψεις
 etc.      etc.
This is it! As you see, there is absolutely nothing new to learn about the future.
Time for practice: What about the future tense of the verbs πλένω and γυρίζω?
Let’s start with πλένω. It is an irregular verb, so you are supposed to have memorized its 
past form (but if you haven’t, go back to Table 8.4 on page 115). OK, the past is έπλυνα. In 
order to get the perfective stem you have to remove everything that belongs to the past. What 
you have is this:
(10) ΠΛ ΥΝ-
You are ready now to add the features of the future:
(11) θα πλύνω
Let’s go to γυρίζω. It is a regular verb, so you can follow the procedure by yourselves: 
(12) γυρίζω  → γύρισα  → ΓΥΡΙΣ- → θα γυρίσω
It is now time to focus on two somewhat problematic points of the future:
• The relationship between the future and the past stem is less clear when it comes to the 
irregular verbs of the following table (most of them have irregular past forms and belong to 

--- Page 137 ---

Chapter 9 | To the Future: The Modern Greek μέλλοντας and More
Page 128
Group 1 of Table 8.3 on page 115). Here again you will have to use your memory and not 
your reason. (If you need to check the meaning of the verbs, go to the Appendix on page 
162. The same holds for the following Tables.)
PRESENT PAST FUTURE
βγαίνω βγήκα θα βγω
βλέπω είδα θα δω
βρίσκω βρήκα θα βρω
έρχομαι ήρθα θα έρθω
έχω είχα θα έχω
λέω είπα θα πω
μπαίνω μπήκα θα μπω
παίρνω πήρα θα πάρω
πηγαίνω/πάω πήγα θα πάω
πίνω ήπια θα πιω
τρώω έφαγα θα φάω
Table 9.1: Verbs with an Irregular Future.
• Verbs in the future are inflected like the present, but which one? (Please note that the Mod-
ern Greek present is not homogeneous.) The answer is rather simple: they go according to 
the inflectional model they look like. Take the following examples:
(13) γράφω  → θα γράψω
 τρώω  → θα φάω
 λέω  → θα πω
In θα γράψω there is a consonant before the (unstressed) -ω, therefore the future goes like 
group A1 (see Unit 4.1.1 on page 54). Θα φάω  looks very much like group Α2 (see Unit 
4.1.2 on page 55), while θα πω goes like group B2 (see Unit 4.1.4 on page 57). Therefore 
there are three inflectional models of the future (group B1 has no representatives in the future):
(Α1) (Α2) (Β2)
SINGULAR
1st θα γράψω θα φάω θα πω
2nd θα γράψεις θα φας θα πεις
3rd θα γράψει θα φάει θα πει
Table 9.2: The Inflectional Models of the Future.

--- Page 138 ---

Chapter 9 | To the Future: The Modern Greek μέλλοντας and More
Page 129
(Α1) (Α2) (Β2)
PLURAL
1st θα γράψουμε θα φάμε θα πούμε
2nd θα γράψετε θα φάτε θα πείτε
3rd θα γράψουν(ε) θα φάνε θα πουν(ε)
Table 9.2: The Inflectional Models of the Future.
The vast majority of verbs in the future go like group A1, and there are only few verbs left for 
groups A2 and B2.
The affinity between the past and future stems may work the other way round. If your 
coursebook introduces the future prior to the past, all you have to do is follow the opposite 
procedure:
• Remove the particle θα, the stress, and the endings of the future. What you will get is 
the perfective stem:
(I) θα δουλέψω → ΔΟΥ ΛΕΨ-
 θα γράψω → ΓΡΑΨ-
• Now you are ready to apply the rules of the past: add the endings and the stress follow-
ing the tri-syllabic rule.
(ΙΙ) ΔΟΥ ΛΕΨ- → δούλεψα
 ΓΡΑΨ-  → έγραψα
9.1.2 The Use of μέλλοντας
Τhe Modern Greek simple future is used to describe actions that are going to take place after the 
moment of speaking. Therefore, it typically combines with three major groups of adverbials:
• Adverbs related to the future:
αύριο “tomorrow”
μεθαύριο “the day after tomorrow”
του χρόνου “next year”
Table 9.3: Adverbs Related to the Future.
• Prepositional phrases introduced by σε:
(14) Σε δύο μέρες / εβδομάδες / μήνες θα πάω στην Αθήνα.
 “Ι will go to Athens in two days / weeks / months.”

--- Page 139 ---

Chapter 9 | To the Future: The Modern Greek μέλλοντας and More
Page 130
• The single (non-prepositional) temporal accusative modified by the adjectives άλλος (“oth-
er”) / επόμενος (“next”):
(15a) Την άλλη / επόμενη εβδομάδα θα πάμε στην Αθήνα.
 “We will go to Athens next week.”
(15b) Tον άλλο / επόμενο μήνα θα πάω στην Κρήτη.
 “Ι will go to Crete next month.”
The future is also compatible with several time expressions typically related to the present:
(ΙΙΙ) Θα έρθω σήμερα.
 “I will come today.”
The interrogative and the negative versions of the future are no surprise. As with the pres-
ent or the past tenses, they are formed by intonation and the addition of the particle δεν 
(always before the particle θα) respectively:
(ΙVa) Θα πάει σινεμά.
 “She/He will go to the movies.”
(IVb) Θα πάει σινεμά;
 “ Will she/he go to the movies?”
(IVc) Δεν θα πάει σινεμά.
 “She/He will not go to the movies.”
Personal pronouns must be posited right before the “real” verb of the verbal construction 
(see Unit 6.1 on page 84).
(V) A: Θα δεις τον Πέτρο; “Will you see Peter?”
 Β1: Ναι, θα τον δω.  “Yes, I will see him.”
 Β2: Όχι, δεν θα τον δω. “No, I won’t see him.”
9.2 The Modern Greek “Infinitive”
The semantic affinity between future tenses and infinitives across languages is the basis for the 
formal affinity between the Modern Greek future simple and the Modern Greek “infinitive”. 
And this is where there are really good news for absolute beginners.

--- Page 140 ---

Chapter 9 | To the Future: The Modern Greek μέλλοντας and More
Page 131
9.2.1 The Form of the “Infinitive”
Check the following sentences:
(16a) Θα οδηγήσω.  (FUTURE SIMPLE)
 “I will drive.”
(16b) Θέλω να οδηγήσω. (“INFINITIVE”)
 “I want to drive.”
Ιn order to form the “infinitive” all you have to do is take the verb in the future and replace θα 
with να, which is equivalent to the English to.
Keep in mind that the Modern Greek “infinitive” is a rather peculiar case of “infinitive” (the 
technical term for it is “subjunctive”). Let’s start with the following examples:
(17a) Θέλω να οδηγήσω.
 “ I want to drive.”
(17b) Θέλει να οδηγήσει.
 “ She/He wants to drive.”
(17c) Θέλουμε να οδηγήσουμε.
 “ We want to drive.”
Unlike English infinitives, and infinitives in general, the Modern Greek “infinitive” is inflected 
according to person and number. It then forms an entire inflectional model, which copies the 
inflectional models of the future (with να replacing θα). Compare to Table 9.2 on page 128:
(Α1) (Α2) (Β2)
SINGULAR
1st να γράψω να φάω να πω
2nd να γράψεις να φας να πεις
3rd να γράψει να φάει να πει
PLURAL
1st να γράψουμε να φάμε να πούμε
2nd να γράψετε να φάτε να πείτε
3rd να γράψουν(ε) να φάνε να πουν(ε)
Table 9.4: The Inflectional Models of the “Infinitive”.

--- Page 141 ---

Chapter 9 | To the Future: The Modern Greek μέλλοντας and More
Page 132
Let’s see now the following sentences:
(18a) Θέλω να οδηγήσω.
 “ I want (-) to drive.”
(18b) Θέλω να οδηγήσεις.
 “ I want you to drive.”
In 18a the speaker has an intention that will be fulfilled by himself. In 18b, the speaker has an 
intention that will be fulfilled by another person. In order to express the difference, you simply 
change the person of the “infinitive” according to the person who will perform the action.
9.2.2 The Use of the “Infinitive”
“Infinitives” depend on other verbs, called main verbs (usually modal verbs like must, should, 
may etc.). Here is a list of basic verbs for levels A1-A2:
θέλω πρέπει
μπορώ μπορεί
προτιμώ χρειάζεται
προσπαθώ
λέω
σκέφτομαι
πάω
έχω
Table 9.5: Verbs with an “Infinitive” as a Complement.
A few remarks about main verbs:
• All main verbs require a full “infinitive”. In other words, in Modern Greek you cannot re -
move να from the “infinitive”:
(19a) Θέλω να οδηγήσω.
 “I want to drive.”
(19b) Mπορώ να οδηγήσω.
 “I can (-) drive.”
• Unlike the verbs of the left column that vary according to person, the verbs of the right 
column do not:

--- Page 142 ---

Chapter 9 | To the Future: The Modern Greek μέλλοντας and More
Page 133
(20a) Θέλει να γράψει ένα γράμμα.
 “She/He wants to write a letter.”
(20b) Θέλουμε να γράψουμε ένα γράμμα.
 “We want to write a letter.”
(20c) Πρέπει να γράψει ένα γράμμα.
 “She/He must write a letter.”
(20d) Πρέπει να γράψουμε ένα γράμμα.
 “We must write a letter.”
Verbs like πρέπει (equivalent to must, ought to, should) have only one form (usually taken 
from the third person singular) to denote all persons. In terms of meaning such verbs have no 
person (this is why they are called “impersonal” in grammar) and the person is taken from the 
“infinitive”.
• Let’s go now to issues of meaning. Most verbs on the list may be used with or without an 
“infinitive” and retain the same meaning everywhere:
(21a) Θέλω μια μπίρα.
 “I want/need a beer”.
(21b) Θέλω να πιω μια μπίρα.
 “I want/need to have a beer.”
Some verbs, though, come with a different meaning when used as main verbs:
(22a) Λέω την αλήθεια. / Λέω ψέματα.
 “I tell the truth.” / “I tell lies.”
(22b) Λέω να πάω σινεμά.
 “I am planning to go to the movies.”
 “I am thinking about going to the movies.”
 “I am considering going to the movies.”
The structure πάω+“infinitive” is not equivalent to the English be going to. The Modern 
Greek construction is still closer to motion, and the sense of futurity is rather weak.

--- Page 143 ---

Chapter 9 | To the Future: The Modern Greek μέλλοντας and More
Page 134
There is a significant difference between the personal μπορώ and the impersonal μπορεί. 
The first expresses ability, while the second expresses probability.
(VIa) Μπορώ να οδηγήσω.
 “I can drive.” / “I am able to drive.”
(VIb) Μπορεί να οδηγήσω.
 “I may drive.” / “Μaybe I’ll drive.”
What about the following sentence?
(VII) Ο Πέτρος μπορεί να οδηγήσει.
The above sentence may have two readings: a) Peter is able to drive, and b) Maybe Peter 
will drive. This happens because the verb is in the third person singular so you cannot 
know a priori whether it represents the personal μπορώ or the impersonal μπορεί. How can 
we tell which one is the correct reading? It is the context now that helps us decide about 
the most appropriate reading.
Χρειάζεται is the impersonal version of the verb χρειάζομαι (“to need”). It usually comes 
as part of interrogative or negative sentences:
(VIIIa) Χρειάζεται να πάρω ομπρέλα;
 “ Do I need to take an umbrella?”
(VIIIb) Δεν χρειάζεται να πάρεις ομπρέλα.
 “You do not need to take an umbrella.”
• Main verbs may be explicit or implicit (presupposed) in sentences like the following: 
(23a) (-) να φάω τα πατατάκια;
(23b) (-) να πας στο δωμάτιό σου.
Here the missing main verb can be reconstructed by the context. I would easily choose μπορώ 
for sentence 23a, and πρέπει or θέλω for sentence 23b:
(24a) (Μπορώ) να φάω τα πατατάκια;
 (“May I eat the potato chips?”)
(24b) (Θέλω) να πας στο δωμάτιό σου. / (Πρέπει) να πας στο δωμάτιό σου. 
 “I want you to go to your room.” / “You must go to your room.”

--- Page 144 ---

Chapter 9 | To the Future: The Modern Greek μέλλοντας and More
Page 135
An implicit main verb is typical of actions with a social relevance, like asking for permission or 
giving orders. In terms of social convenience, omitting the main verb would make things easier 
for the one who is asking for something (as in 23a) or the one who is asked to do something 
(as in 23b).
Let’s now focus again on “infinitives” inside these structures. What you should keep in mind 
are the following:
• Modern Greek “infinitives” are tenseless. Their relevance to time is taken up by the main 
verb:
(25a) Μπορώ να οδηγήσω.
 “I can drive.”
(25b) Μπόρεσα να οδηγήσω.
 “I was able to drive.” / “I could drive.”
(25c) Θα μπορέσω να οδηγήσω.
 “I will be able to drive.”
• Questions with an “infinitive” are again easy to form:
(26) Θέλεις να οδηγήσεις;
 “ Do you want to drive?”
• “Infinitives” combine with the negative particle μην instead of δεν:
(27) Θέλω να μην οδηγήσω σήμερα
 “I want not to drive today.” = “I’d rather not drive today.”
Notice that negating the “infinitive” is not totally equivalent to negating the main verb:
(28a) Δεν θέλω να οδηγήσω.
 “I don’t want to drive today.”
(28b) Θέλω να μην οδηγήσω σήμερα.
 “I’d rather not drive today.”
Considering similar constructions (see Units 6.1 on page 84 and 9.1.2 on page 130), the 
position of the personal pronouns is not a surprise. Notice, though, that such a pronoun must 
stay within the scope of the “infinitive” and not attach itself to the main verb (check the incor-

rect B3).
(29) Α: Θέλεις να δεις τον Πέτρο;  “Do you want to see Peter?”
 Β1: Ναι, θέλω να τον δω.  “Yes, I want to see him.”
 B2: Όχι, δεν θέλω να τον δω.  “No, I don’t want to see him.”
 B3: 
  Ναι, τον θέλω να δω.
After a painful present and past, the future is really nicer for the verb “to be”. All you have 
to do is add θα or να to its present and take the future simple or the “infinitive” (θα είμαι, 
να είμαι). 
9.3 Back to Conditional Clauses
Having acquired the necessary grammar, let’s go back to conditional clauses:
(30a) Aν πεινάς, θα βρεις φαγητό στο ψυγείο.
 “If you are hungry, you will find some food in the fridge.”
(30b) Aν (θα) πεινάσεις, θα βρεις φαγητό στο ψυγείο.
 “If you get hungry, you will find some food in the fridge.”
Example 30a refers to a present situation, and the tense of the if-clause is the present. Exam -
ple 30b refers to a future situation, and the tense of the if-clause is the future simple, with the 
particle θα being explicit or implicit. Both examples illustrate factual conditionals, that is con-
ditionals whose conclusion seems possible.
Let’s see the following cases:
(31a) Aν πεινάσεις, θα βρεις φαγητό στο ψυγείο.
 “If you get hungry, you will find some food in the fridge.”
(31b) Αν πεινάσεις, μπορείς να βρεις φαγητό στο ψυγείο.
 “If you get hungry, you can find some food in the fridge.”
The conclusion of a factual conditional may be represented by the future tense or an “infini -
tive”.
What about counterfactual conditionals? At this moment you simply cannot do it. Counter-
factual conditionals need a lot more regarding the verbal system, which makes them part of 
levels B2 or C1.

Chapter 9 | To the Future: The Modern Greek μέλλοντας and More
Page 137
Έλα!
This is one of the first words absolute beginners recognize within the flow of fast everyday 
Modern Greek as spoken by natives. Έλα is equivalent to Come!. Apart from its common 
use, it appears in several contexts with a variable meaning. People answer their phone 
saying έλα! when they see a call from a friend. People say έλα! when they hear something 
which is hard to believe. People also say έλα! when they want to express irony. Finally, 
people say έλα! when they need to hear something again.
In terms of grammar έλα! represents the imperative of the verb έρχομαι. Imperatives 
express commands, that is direct requests, which are not to be questioned. Commands 
come with an air of authority that excludes them from the area of politeness (see Chapter 
6 on page 93). Most of the time people instead of the imperative people prefer to use a 
structure with the “infinitive” in order to sound less forceful:
(IX) Έλα τώρα! = Μπορείς να έρθεις τώρα; / Θέλω να έρθεις τώρα.
 “ Come now!” = “Can you come now?” / “I want you to come now.”
Imperatives love any context that does not require politeness. Therefore they are typical in 
informal everyday situations, as well as situations where a command would be appreciated 
by the recipient. If I were directing a (desperate) unknown driver park her/his car in a nar-
row place, I would use lots of imperatives and she/he would not mind at all. 
Imperatives represent another chapter of the Modern Greek grammar, which is usually 
part of levels B1-B2. As absolute beginners then you should stick to indirect requests as 
expressed by the “infinitive”. But still I believe you should know some basic imperatives 
of everyday use:
(X) (αφήνω) άσε   “leave”, “let”
 (δίνω)  δώσε   “give”
 (κάθομαι) κάθισε/κάτσε  “sit”
 (κοιτάζω) κοίτα   “look”
 (πάω)  πήγαινε/άντε  “go”
 (παίρνω) πάρε   “take”, “get”
 (φεύγω) φύγε   “go away”
SUMMARY
Future tenses and infinitives share a common ground in terms of meaning, which explains their 
formal resemblance in several languages (one of them is Modern Greek). Chapter 9 introduces 
the Modern Greek μέλλοντας and “infinitive” in terms of their form and use.

Chapter 10 | Back to Nouns: Genitive Case
Page 139
CHAPTER 10 | Back to Nouns: Genitive Case
Nouns are usually preceded by words that provide extra information about them. This is the 
case with articles, numerals, simple or pronominal adjectives (see Chapters 5 on page 66 and 
6 on page 82).
(1a) αυτό το παλιό αυτοκίνητο
 “ this (-) old car”
(1b) δύο παλιά αυτοκίνητα
 “ two old cars”
Is there anything to come after the noun? Yes, other nouns. One such case is familiar to you as 
apposition (see Unit 3.2.3 on page 40):
(2) O άντρας της, ο Πέτρος, είναι από τον Καναδά. 
 “ Her husband, Peter, is from Canada.”
Apposition is not unique in this respect. Check the following sentence:
(3) O άντρας της Μαρίας είναι από τον Καναδά.
 “ Mary’s husband is from Canada.”
The phrases in blue letters in sentences 2 and 3 modify the “head” noun άντρας, but in a dif -
ferent way. Peter and the husband in 2 refer to the same person (Peter is simply the name of 
the husband). Mary and the husband in 3 obviously refer to two different persons (Mary is the 
name of the wife). Syntactically, identity of reference like in 2 is the basis for agreement (in 
this case the nouns share the same gender, number, and case). Difference of reference like in 
3 explains the lack of agreement between the two nouns. In the case of 3 the nouns differ in 
gender and case (sameness of number is only accidental here). The phrase ο άντρας represents 
the nominative, as you already know. The phrase της Μαρίας represents the genitive case, the 
third of the three major cases of the Modern Greek case system.
10.1 The Use of the Genitive
Unlike the nominative or the accusative cases, whose roles are related to major constituents of 
the sentence like the subject or the object, the genitive keeps a rather secondary role:

--- Page 149 ---

Chapter 10 | Back to Nouns: Genitive Case
Page 140
(4a) Ο άντρας της Μαρίας είναι από τον Καναδά.
 “ Mary’s husband is from Canada.”
(4b) Ξέρω τον άντρα της Μαρίας.
 “I know Mary’s husband.”
The phrase της Μαρίας, a typical genitive, depends on the “head” noun άντρας in 4a-b. Note 
that the genitive is not affected by any shift in the case of the “head” noun. Note also that it 
always follows the “head” noun, never precedes it.
The genitive may also depend on a “head” noun in the genitive, as in the following exam-
ple:
(I) Έχω το τηλέφωνο του άντρα της Μαρίας.
 “I have the phone number of Mary’s husband.”
As far as meaning is concerned, the genitive covers a wide range of semantic relations. Among 
them, possession is perhaps the most elementary and easy to perceive. The genitive establishes 
a relation between the possessor (the noun in the genitive) and the possessed entity (the “head” 
noun).
(5a) το σπίτι της Μαρίας
 “ Mary’s house”
(5b) η μύτη της Μαρίας
 “ Mary’s nose”
(5c) η μητέρα της Μαρίας
 “ Mary’s mother”
Sentence 5a illustrates typical possession (you can sell your house), while sentences 5b-c are 
instances of natural possession (a nose or a mother are not things to be sold, but you’ve still 
got them).
Typical possession in Modern Greek may be mediated by the verb είμαι:
(II) Aυτό το σπίτι είναι της Μαρίας.
 “This house belongs to Mary”.
The genitive also covers relationships that can hardly be perceived as possessives:

--- Page 150 ---

Chapter 10 | Back to Nouns: Genitive Case
Page 141
(6a) η παραίτηση της Μαρίας
 “ Mary’s resignation”
(6b) η απόλυση της Μαρίας
 “ Mary’s dismissal”
Here the “head” noun is usually an abstract noun deriving from a verb. If I turned this noun 
into the verb it derives from, the genitive would have to be the subject or the object of the verb 
(Mary’ s resignation = Mary [SUBJ.] resigned).
The above examples illustrate only some basic uses of the Modern Greek genitive. After ex-
amining the form of the genitive I shall come back to matters of use in Unit 10.3 on page 145.
10.2 The Form of the Genitive
Let’s see how the genitive works for major categories of Modern Greek nouns and noun-de -
pendent words. As we did with the accusative, here again our starting point will be the nomi -
native.
10.2.1 The Genitive of Nouns
NOMINATIVE GENITIVE
MASCULINE ο δρόμος του δρόμου
ο άντρας του άντρα
ο χάρτης του χάρτη
FEMININE η ώρα της ώρας
η ζώνη της ζώνης
NEUTER το βιβλίο του βιβλίου
το παιδί του παιδιού
το πράγμα του πράγματος
Table 10.1: Genitive Singular for Basic Modern Greek Nouns.
A few remarks about the genitive:
• Like with the accusative, the shift from the nominative to the genitive involves shifts in the 
definite article and in the ending of the noun.
(7) ο δρόμος → του δρόμου
 η ώρα  → της ώρας
 το βιβλίο → του βιβλίου

--- Page 151 ---

Chapter 10 | Back to Nouns: Genitive Case
Page 142
• Like in the case of the plural, the genitive seems to obscure the boundaries between gender 
groups. Masculine nouns in -ος and neuter nouns in -o behave the same way:
(8) ο δρόμος → του δρόμου
 το βιβλίο → του βιβλίου
• Masculine nouns in -ας / -ης and feminine nouns in -α / -η follow a complementary pattern. 
The former remove their final -ς, while the latter take a final -ς:
(9) ο άντρας → του άντρα
 ο χάρτης → του χάρτη
 η ώρα  → της ώρας
 η ζώνη  → της ζώνης
• Finally, neuter nouns ending in -ι or -μα behave in a similar way, since they get an addition-
al unit. Note that for neuters in -ι the stress falls obligatorily on this unit:
(10) το παιδί → του παιδιού
 τ ο σπίτι → του σπιτιού
 το γράμμα → του γράμματος
Listen again to the words παιδιού, σπιτιού. Do you hear the [i] before the new ending? 
I guess you don’t. Why? The now unstressed [i] comes before a stressed vowel and as a 
result it turns into a consonant (see Unit 1.6.2 on page 13).
Neuter nouns in -μα acquire this additional unit as an extra syllable. So, when the noun in 
the nominative is stressed on the third syllable, there is a problem: No Modern Greek word 
can be stressed beyond the antepenultimate syllable. In order to avoid this problem, the 
stress moves to the next syllable on the right.
(ΙΙI) το διαμέρισμα → του διαμερίσματος
• All nouns share the same genitive plural regarding the article and the endings:
(11) (ο δρόμος) → των δρόμων
 (η ώρα) → των ωρών
 (το βιβλίο) → των βιβλίων

--- Page 152 ---

Chapter 10 | Back to Nouns: Genitive Case
Page 143
This sounds like good news, but it’s not. Check the noun ώρα. As you see, there is a shift in 
the position of the stress. The genitive (not only in the plural, but also in the singular) involves 
such shifts. You will have to wait for levels B1-B2 in order to have an overview of these shifts. 
10.2.2 The Genitive of Noun-Dependent Words
As you already know, adjectives follow the inflectional model of some categories of nouns (see 
Unit 5.4). This is also true about the genitive, and here is how it goes:
MASCULINE FEMININE NEUTER
SINGULAR ακριβού ακριβής ακριβού
PLURAL ακριβών
SINGULAR νέου νέας νέου
PLURAL νέων
Table 10.2: Genitive Singular and Plural for Basic Modern Greek Adjectives.
The same holds for every regular adjective or pronoun of Chapters 5 and 6. There are, however, 
irregular cases in which you might need some help:
(ποιος) → ποιανού / τίνος
(ένας - ένα) → ενός - ενός
(κανένας - κανένα) → κανενός - κανενός
(τρεις - τρία) → τριών - τριών
(τέσσερις - τέσσερα) → τεσσάρων - τεσσάρων
Table 10.3: The Genitive of Irregular Noun-Dependent Words.
How Old Are You?
“How old are you” in Modern Greek goes like this:
(IV) Πόσων χρονών είσαι;
The idiom involves the genitive of the noun χρόνος (“year”). Accordingly the answer in-
volves the genitive, and consequently a problem if your age includes the irregular numer-
als of Table 10.3:
(Va) Είμαι είκοσι ενός χρονών.
(Vb) Είμαι τριάντα τριών χρονών.
(Vc) Είμαι εξήντα τεσσάρων χρονών.

--- Page 153 ---

Chapter 10 | Back to Nouns: Genitive Case
Page 144
10.2.3 Possessive Pronouns: μου / σου / του
When a genitive needs not be present in speech again and again, possessive pronouns are here 
to help.
(12) Mary’s nose is big. Her eyes are blue...
Modern Greek possessive pronouns follow the syntax of the genitive case. This is why they 
always follow the “head” noun (note that the “head” noun is always preceded by the definite 
article in such constructions).
(13) τo σπίτι της Μαρίας / το σπίτι της
 “ Mary’s house” / “her house”
In terms of agreement, Modern Greek possessive pronouns must have the same gender, number 
and case with the genitive they are to replace:
(14) το σπίτι της Μαρίας / το σπίτι της
 το σπίτι του Πέτρου / το σπίτι του
 τ ο σπίτι του παιδιού / το σπίτι του
The full group of Modern Greek possessive pronouns is the following:
SINGULAR
1st μου “my”
2nd σου “your”
3rd του / της / του “his” / “her” / “its”
PLURAL
1st μας “our”
2nd σας “your”
3rd τους “their”
Table 10.4: Possessive Pronouns.
The pronouns of the 3rd person replace nouns in the genitive. What about the pronouns of 
the 1st and 2nd person? They replace nothing. In fact, they represent the only way to refer 
to “I” or “You” inside a possessive relationship.

--- Page 154 ---

Chapter 10 | Back to Nouns: Genitive Case
Page 145
Modern Greek possessive pronouns are phonetically weak words, words without an inher-
ent stress. In order to acquire one, they are taken together with the “head” noun, to create 
a larger phonetic unit:
(VI) το σπίτι μου
 [to spitimu]
What if the “head” noun is stressed on the antepenultimate?
(VII) το τηλέφωνo μου
 [to tilefonomu]
Now this larger phonetic is stressed beyond the antepenultimate, a problem for the rules of 
the Modern Greek stress. This is why such units develop a secondary stress:
(VIII) το τηλέφωνό μου
 [to tilefonomu]
This secondary stress is stronger than the initial one, and always falls on the last syllable 
of the “head” noun:
(IX) το αυτοκίνητό μου
 το διαμέρισμά μου
10.3 Back to Use: “Categorial” Genitive
Compare the following sentences:
(15a) Η Άννα θέλει ένα ποτήρι νερό.
(15b) Η Άννα θέλει ένα ποτήρι του νερού.
Anna of sentence 15a needs a glass full of water (see Unit 3.2.3 on page 40). Anna of sen -
tence 15b does not a glass full of water. She needs a specific type of glass made to drink water. 
The genitive in this case is used as a means to categorize glasses according to their type or 
function.
(16a) ποτήρι του νερού (ποτήρι για το νερό)
(16b) ποτήρι της μπίρας (ποτήρι για την μπίρα)
(16c) ποτήρι του κρασιού (ποτήρι για το κρασί)
The “categorial” genitive is really extended in Modern Greek to cover numerous items of 
everyday life. Here is a short list:

--- Page 155 ---

Chapter 10 | Back to Nouns: Genitive Case
Page 146
(17) κουτάλι (της) σούπας   “soup spoon = big spoon”
 κουτάλι / κουταλάκι (του) γλυκού  “tea spoon”
 φλιτζάνι (του) καφέ   “coffee cup”
 φλιτζάνι (του) τσαγιού  “tea cup”
 σοκολάτα υγείας   “bitter chocolate”
 σοκολάτα γάλακτος   “plain chocolate”
 γυαλιά ηλίου    “sun glasses”
 χαρτί υγείας    “[hygienic] tissue paper”
 φακοί επαφής    “contact lenses”
Note that the definite article may be omitted, a sign that the genitive and the “head” noun usu-
ally come together to form a periphrasis.
“Categorial” genitive can be paraphrased by the preposition για (κουτάλι της σούπας = 
κουτάλι για τη σούπα), but also by other prepositions such as από (φέτα Ηπείρου=φέτα 
από την Ήπειρο, see below), even by an adjective: σοκολάτα υγείας equals to bitter choc-
olate.
Φέτα
Φέτα is a popular Greek white cheese made from sheep’s milk or goat’s and sheep’s milk. 
It has been a protected designation of origin product (PDO, or ΠΟΠ in Modern Greek). 
According to the relevant legislation, only some areas of Greece (the mainland and the is-
lands that belong to the prefecture of Lesvos) may use the term “feta” for the white cheese 
they produce, provided they use this kind of milk in fixed proportions and follow traditional 
practices.
Φέτα does not taste the same throughout these areas. Φέτα from Τρίπολη (a city in the 
Peloponnese) is famous for its spicy aftertaste, while φέτα from Ήπειρος is equally famous 
for its mild taste. It is then important to know where φέτα comes from. This is where the 
“categorial” genitive comes to make things clear:
(X) φέτα Τριπόλεως
 φέτα Ηπείρου
SUMMARY
Chapter 10 introduces the genitive case of nouns and noun-dependent words and exemplifies 
its use taking possessive relations as a starting point. The chapter also examines possessive 
pronouns because of their syntactic and semantic affinity with the genitive.

CHAPTER 11 | Beyond Grammar: Some Notes on Vocabulary
Languages may resemble or differ in terms of their grammar. Languages may also resemble or 
differ in terms of their vocabulary. Now that the basic Modern Greek grammar is practically 
over, let me bring the Modern Greek vocabulary into foreground. For the last few pages of this 
grammar book, we shall leave the grammar aside and focus on vocabulary units (single words 
or periphrases) as such, and not as parts of an example used to illustrate the grammar. The 
emphasis will be on the peculiarities of the Modern Greek vocabulary, which usually cause 
confusion to learners of Modern Greek. The point of departure will be the English vocabulary, 
but I believe you will be able to find analogies with your mother tongue.
11.1 Lexical Asymmetries
Most words from English seem to have an equivalent in Modern Greek. Expensive is ακριβός, 
table is equivalent to τραπέζι, etc. etc.
Let’s now check the following examples:
(1a) Έχασα τα κλειδιά μου.
 “I lost my keys.”
(1b) Έχασα το λεωφορείο.
 “I missed the bus.”
In this case two English words correspond to just one Modern Greek word. This is an instance 
of lexical asymmetry between the two languages. This kind of asymmetry can be found in 
count and measure (both are equivalent to μετράω), hear and listen (ακούω stands for both of 
them), or sorry and excuse me (both are represented by συγνώμη). This kind of asymmetry is 
not a problem for you. You can simply enjoy the fact that you have to learn only one new word 
instead of two (or more). But still you need to know which words to equal to this new word.
Let’s now see the following sentences:
(2a) Σκέφτομαι τον Πέτρο.
 “I am thinking of / about Peter.”
(2b) Νομίζω ότι έχει δίκιο.
 “I think he is right.”

--- Page 159 ---

Chapter 11 | Beyond Grammar: Some Notes on V ocabulary
Page 150
Now one English word corresponds to two Modern Greek words. This is again a lexical asym-
metry. But this time the asymmetry is not that easy to handle. You must have some sort of 
directions in order to determine how to use each Modern Greek word properly.
The previous examples illustrate only some clear cases of lexical asymmetries. I believe 
they were enough to make you realize what we are talking about. Having these in mind, let’s 
now turn to some basic cases of lexical asymmetry between English and Modern Greek:
ακόμα
ακόμα is a word with several meanings depending on the context:
• In affirmative sentences, ακόμα means still:
(3) Είμαι ακόμα στην Αθήνα.
 “I am still in Athens.”
• In negative sentences it is equivalent to yet:
(4) Δεν έφτασα ακόμα στην Αθήνα.
 “I have not arrived to Athens yet.”
• Finally, taken together with a quantifier, ακόμα is equivalent to more:
(5) Θα ήθελα λίγο καφέ ακόμα.
 “I would like some more coffee.”
άντρας - γυναίκα - παιδί
Apart from their primary biological meaning (“man”, “woman”, “child” / “kid”), in everyday 
language these words are widely used with different meanings.
• The words άντρας - γυναίκα equal to “husband” and “wife”. In this case they are usually 
followed by a possessive pronoun:
(6) Χαιρετίσματα στον άντρα σου.
 “Μy regards to your housband.”
• The word παιδί usually is equivalent to “guy”, “champ”, “fellow”:
 [the speaker is an elderly person]
(7) O Γιάννης είναι καλό παιδί.
Γιάννης in the above sentence may very well be 80 years old and still be a nice παιδί.
Notice that unlike the English man, the word άντρας cannot refer to human beings in gen -

--- Page 160 ---

Chapter 11 | Beyond Grammar: Some Notes on V ocabulary
Page 151
eral, but only to males. There is another word equal to human being: άνθρωπος. Άνθρωπος 
may look better than man regarding sex discrimination, but is it?  Its gender is masculine, not 
feminine or neuter.
γιατί - επειδή
Clauses of cause/reason in Modern Greek may be introduced either by γιατί or by επειδή. The 
two words basically differ in terms of syntax: A clause introduced by επειδή may precede or 
follow the main clause, but a clause introduced by γιατί can only follow it:
(8a) Πέρασε το τεστ γιατί / επειδή διάβασε πολύ.
 “She/He passed the test because she/he studied hard.”
(8b) Επειδή / 
  Γιατί διάβασε πολύ, πέρασε το τεστ.
 “ Because she/he studied hard, she/he passed the test.”
Γιατί (unlike επειδή) is also used in direct or indirect questions (see Unit 7.3 on page 109).
Apart from syntax, γιατί and επειδή seem to differ in terms of meaning. Let me introduce 
an elementary scenario. Peter’s mother is talking to her mother in law. She is saying that 
John is Peter’s best friend. Peter, who is present, interrupts his mother saying:
(Ia) Δεν είναι (ο Γιάννης) ο πιο καλός μου φίλος, γιατί / επειδή μαλώσαμε.
 “John is not my best friend, because we had a fight.”
(Ib) Δεν είναι (ο Γιάννης) ο πιο καλός μου φίλος, γιατί / 
 επειδή ο πιο καλός μου 
φίλος είναι ο Κώστας.
 “John is not my best friend, because my best friend is Costas.”
The clause introduced by γιατί/επειδή (Ia) represents a clear case of cause-effect relations. 
Peter had a fight with John, so John is not Peter’s best friend. The clause introduced by 
γιατί (Ib) represents a more elaborated cause-effect relation. Costas is Peter’s best friend, 
therefore the mother cannot claim that John is Peter’s best friend.
διαβάζω - σπουδάζω - μαθαίνω
• The verb διαβάζω refers to any activity involving reading, i.e. reading for fun or reading 
for learning:
(9a) Διαβάζω εφημερίδα / ένα βιβλίο.
 “I am reading the paper / a book.”
(9b) Διαβάζω Φιλοσοφία γιατί έχουμε τεστ.
 “I am studying Philosophy because we are writing a test.”

--- Page 161 ---

Chapter 11 | Beyond Grammar: Some Notes on V ocabulary
Page 152
• The verb σπουδάζω does not refer to any reading activity. The following sentence
(10) Σπουδάζω Φιλοσοφία.
means simply that the speaker is a student of the Department of Philosophy.
• The verb μαθαίνω refers mostly to new information acquired by someone:
(11a) Έμαθα ότι αύριο δεν έχουμε μάθημα.
 “I heard we are not having class tomorrow.”
(11b) Έμαθα να κάνω κέικ.
 “I learnt how to make a cake.”
(11c) Έμαθα ελληνικά σε δύο χρόνια.
 “I learnt Modern Greek in two years.”
Acquiring new information in this respect may be the result of a mental ability:
(12) Διαβάζει πολύ, αλλά δεν μαθαίνει εύκολα.
 “She/He studies hard, but she/he does not learn easily.”
Acquiring new information is usually facilitated by a teacher:
(13a) Μαθαίνουμε ισπανικά στο Πανεπιστήμιο.
(13b) Μαθαίνω ισπανικά στο σπίτι.
(13c) Μαθαίνω τον Πέτρο ισπανικά.
Sentence 13a presupposes a class (if you study at the Library, then choose διαβάζω). Sentence 
13b sounds normal if I have someone to help me with Spanish: a private teacher, a friend who 
speaks Spanish or even a method of individual learning (if you want to say that you study at 
home, choose again διαβάζω). Finally in sentence 13c the verb μαθαίνω simply means “to 
teach”.
δίκιο/άδικο - σωστό/λάθος
Δίκιο and σωστό correspond to the English right, and the same holds for their opposites and 
their relationship to the word wrong.
• Σωστό/λάθος are related to correctness as a result of verification. They are then related to 

--- Page 162 ---

Chapter 11 | Beyond Grammar: Some Notes on V ocabulary
Page 153
all kinds of verifiable statements: Α sentence or a mathematical problem may be σωστό or 
λάθος:
(14a) Αυτή η πρόταση είναι σωστή / λάθος.
 “This sentence is right / wrong.”
(14b) Αυτό το πρόβλημα είναι σωστό / λάθος.
 “This problem is right / wrong.”
• Δίκιο/άδικο are related to correctness as a result of judgement. Judgement is a property of 
humans. Therefore only humans may have δίκιο or άδικο.
(15) A: Πρέπει να φύγουμε. Θα αργήσουμε. “We must go. We’ll be late.”
 B: Έχεις δίκιο. Πάμε.    “You are right. Let’s go.”
People in Modern Greek cannot be σωστό/λάθος but can lead themselves to something right or 
wrong:
(16) Έκανα μόνο ένα λάθος στο τεστ.
 “I made only one mistake in the test”.
καινούριος - παλιός
The adjectives καινούριος and παλιός do what the English adjectives new and old do:
(17a) τα καινούρια παπούτσια / τα παλιά παπούτσια
 “the new shoes” / “the old shoes”
(17b) ο καινούριος γιατρός / ο παλιός γιατρός
 “the new doctor” / “the old doctor”
What these adjectives cannot do is refer to someone’s age (“someone” here includes humans 
and animals):
(18a) H Ελένη είναι πιο μικρή / νέα από τον Πέτρο.
 “Helen is younger than Peter.”
(18b) H Ελένη είναι πιο μεγάλη από τον Πέτρο.
 “Helen is older than Peter.”
The use of νέος (“young”) is pretty clear. The adjectives μικρός / μεγάλος (which originally 

--- Page 163 ---

Chapter 11 | Beyond Grammar: Some Notes on V ocabulary
Page 154
mean “small” and “big”) are the basic adjectives which refer to a person’s age. The meta -
phor is based on the original meaning of the words: children are smaller than adults and they 
grow up to become like them. These words are widely used to denote age, sometimes instead 
of νέος and definitely instead of the derogatory γέρος (“old”), or the politically correct term 
ηλικιωμένος (“elderly”).
μήπως - ίσως
Many dictionaries translate μήπως as “perhaps”. This is only half the truth, because μήπως is a 
polite “perhaps” / “maybe”, used only in questions. The true “perhaps” is ίσως, used in every 
type of sentence:
(19a) Μήπως θέλεις καφέ;
 “ Perhaps you need a coffee?”
(19b) Ίσως θα πάμε για καφέ το απόγευμα.
 “ Perhaps we’ll go for a coffee this afternoon.”
πότε - όταν 
There are two types of “when” in Modern Greek. Πότε is used only in questions, direct or indi-
rect, while όταν is used in temporal clauses (see Unit 7.3 on page 108):
(20a) Πότε φεύγεις;
 “ When are you leaving?”
(20b) Με ρώτησε πότε θα φύγω.
 “She/He asked me when I was going to leave.”
(20c) Όταν γυρίζω σπίτι βγάζω τα παπούτσια μου.
 “ When I come home I take my shoes off.”
ρέστα - ψιλά
These two words represent the word change in Modern Greek. Ρέστα represents the 8 euros 
you get back when you pay 10 euros for a chocolate bar that costs 2 euros:
(21) Έδωσα 10 ευρώ και πήρα ρέστα 8 ευρώ.
 “I paid 10 euros and the change was 8 euros.”
Ψιλά represents small change (cents, 1 or 2 euros) as opposed to large currency units (5, 10, 20 
euros etc.). This is what a kiosk woman/man will ask you if you try to buy a 2-euro chocolate 

--- Page 164 ---

Chapter 11 | Beyond Grammar: Some Notes on V ocabulary
Page 155
bar with 50 euros:
(22) Μήπως έχετε ψιλά;
 “Perhaps you have change?”
σκέφτομαι - νομίζω
What is thinking? The term refers to a mental, non-verbal process that might conclude with the 
verbal expression of an opinion. The verb σκέφτομαι refers mainly to the mental process itself, 
while νομίζω associates mostly with the product of this process:
(23a) Σκέφτομαι τον Πέτρο.
 “I am thinking of/about Peter.”
(23b) Σκέφτομαι να πάω σινεμά.
 “I am thinking of going to the cinema.”
(23c) Nομίζω ότι θα έρθει.
 “I think she/he will come.”
φεύγω - αφήνω
Let’s see the following sentences:
(24a) Φεύγω στις 08.00.
 “I am leaving at 08.00.”
(24b) Αφήνω το βιβλίο στο τραπέζι.
 “I am leaving the book on the table.”
Φεύγω is always an intransitive verb, that is a verb without an object. Αφήνω is a transitive 
verb, a verb that needs an object. Therefore, φεύγω is more like leave in the sense of “depart”, 
“abandon”, and αφήνω is more like let, in the sense of “putting down”, “depositing”, “permit-
ting”.
11.2 “Natural” Greek
Languages often use different ways to refer to the same simple fact. Let me start with an ele -
mentary example. Greek people have coffee, beer or wine, like people in the English-speaking 
world do. They also enjoy a sandwich at lunch break. But these basic facts are described in 
different terms:

--- Page 165 ---

Chapter 11 | Beyond Grammar: Some Notes on V ocabulary
Page 156
(25a) Πίνω καφέ / μπίρα.
 “Ι have a coffee / a beer.”
(25b) Τρώω ένα σάντουιτς.
 “I have a sandwich.”
Is it a mistake to say Έχω ένα σάντουιτς in Modern Greek? Well, it’s not the end of communi-
cation. Everybody will get what you mean. But it doesn’t sound Greek at all. 
Let me give you another example. Here is what someone would say on a hot or a cold day 
respectively:
(26a) Ζεσταίνομαι.
 “I am hot.”
(26b) Κρυώνω.
 “I am cold.”
The two languages again take a very simple fact and put it differently. Lots of absolute begin-
ners, though, start from the assumption that languages see things the same way and translate 
directly into Modern Greek. People again will understand, but is this enough? No, it is not.
The same differences hold in the field of elementary needs as expressed in English and 
Modern Greek:
(IΙa) Θέλω καφέ.
 “I need coffee.”
(IΙb) Πεινάω.
 “I am hungry.”
(IΙc) Διψάω.
 “I am thirsty.”
(IId) Νυστάζω.
 “I am sleepy”.
Let’s focus now on some everyday periphrases, consisting of a verb and a noun, like to have 
a shower or to do the shopping . This area is problematic in language learning, because there 
seems to be a list of basic verbs to choose from, but every language makes different choices. As 
far as Modern Greek is concerned, κάνω is perhaps the most powerful verb of this list. Κάνω 
often stands for the English verbs to be, to do, to have or to take.

--- Page 166 ---

Chapter 11 | Beyond Grammar: Some Notes on V ocabulary
Page 157
(27a) Τι κάνεις;
 “How are you?”
(27b) Tι δουλειά κάνεις;
 “What do you do for a living?”
(27c) Κάνω ψώνια.
 “Ι do the shopping.”
(27d) Kάνω μπάνιο.
 “Ι have a shower.” / “I take a bath.” / “I swim.”
In some periphrases the verb κάνω may be replaced by the verb έχω:
(28a) Κάνω / Έχω διακοπές.
 “I take / have holidays.”
(28b) Kάνω / Έχω πάρτι.
 “Ι have a party.”
(28c) Kάνω / Έχω διάλειμμα.
 “I take a break.”
(28d) Κάνω / Έχω μάθημα.
 “I have class.”
(28e) Κάνει / Έχει κρύο. / Κάνει / Έχει ζέστη.
 “It is hot.” / “It is cold.”
(28f) Πόσο κάνει / έχει ο καφές;
 “How much is the coffee?”
The two verbs are not totally equivalent. Let’s take 28b: Κάνω πάρτι means that I am the one 
who is organizing the event. Έχω πάρτι means that I am just invited to the event.
Another powerful verb is παίρνω. Παίρνω relates to the English take and get, as it has be-
come a necessary constituent of numerous everyday expressions:
(29a) Παίρνω (τηλέφωνο) τον Πέτρο αλλά δεν απαντάει.
 “Ι call Peter but he does not answer the phone.”

--- Page 167 ---

Chapter 11 | Beyond Grammar: Some Notes on V ocabulary
Page 158
(29b) Πήγα στο σούπερ μάρκετ και πήρα καφέ.
 “I went to the super market and got some coffee.”
(29c) Παίρνω / Βγάζω φωτογραφίες.
 “Ι take pictures.”
The above discussion was not exhaustive of course. There is a lot to be said, but it won’t be. 
The point of this unit was to help you realize that each language represents a slightly differ -
ent way to see things, even the most common and evident ones. Having acquired the basics, I 
believe you must start seeing Modern Greek as insiders. It is time to let yourselves merge into 
the Modern Greek language and hope that study and practice will eventually turn you from an 
absolute beginner to an absolutely stunning advanced learner.

Mιλάω ελληνικά
Τώρα ξέρετε τα βασικά ελληνικά και νομίζω ότι μπορείτε να καταλάβετε αυτά που θα 
γράψω:
Στα ελληνικά ένας άντρας από την Ελλάδα είναι Έλληνας, και μια γυναίκα από την Ελλάδα 
είναι Ελληνίδα:
(IIIa) Ο Πέτρος είναι Έλληνας.
(IIIb) Η Ελένη είναι Ελληνίδα.
Αυτό αλλάζει όταν μιλάμε για κάτι και όχι για κάποιον:
(IVa) Αυτός ο καφές είναι ελληνικός.
(IVb) Αυτή η σοκολάτα είναι ελληνική.
(IVc) Αυτό το βιβλίο είναι ελληνικό.
(IVd) Μιλάω ελληνικά.
Στα ελληνικά, λοιπόν, όταν λέμε από πού είναι κάτι ή κάποιος, δεν έχουμε μία μόνο λέξη 
αλλά τρεις. Αν είσαι από την Ιταλία, τότε είσαι Ιταλός ή Ιταλίδα, αλλά ο εσπρέσο είναι 
ιταλικός καφές. Αν είσαι από την Κίνα, τότε είσαι Κινέζος ή Κινέζα, αλλά μιλάς κινέζικα.
Όλα αυτά δεν είναι μεγάλο πρόβλημα για εσάς. Αν δεν ξέρετε τη λέξη Ιταλός, μπορείτε 
να πείτε Είμαι από την Ιταλία. Είναι ακριβώς το ίδιο. Και να θυμάστε:
• Στα ελληνικά υπάρχει πάντα μια λέξη για τους άντρες και τις γυναίκες, αλλά όχι για τα 
παιδιά. Αν μιλάμε για ένα παιδί μπορούμε μόνο να πούμε Αυτό το παιδί είναι από την 
Ελλάδα.
• Ένας σκύλος ή μια γάτα δεν είναι άνθρωπος. Αν ο σκύλος σας είναι τεριέ από την 
Σκοτία, μπορείτε να πείτε Ο σκύλος μου είναι σκοτσέζικο τεριέ.
SUMMARY
Chapter 11 takes English as a starting point in order to examine some aspects of the Modern 
Greek vocabulary that cause confusion to learners of Modern Greek. The first part of the chap-
ter deals with lexical asymmetries between English and Modern Greek, while the second part 
focuses on periphrases and the main Modern Greek verbs that participate in such construc -
tions.

Basic Modern Greek Verbs Revisited
The following list comprises basic verbs for levels A1-A2. Verbs (in alphabetical order) appear 
in the present, past and future tenses (along with the “infinitive”). Most of these verbs have 
been introduced throughout Chapters 1-11, yet their meaning might be necessary for you.
In order to work with this list, keep in mind the following:
• Some verbs do not easily form with the past and/or the future/“infinitive”. Τhe hyphen 
signals that a verb has no such forms. The parenthesis shows that a form is possible but not 
widely used.
• Some verbs have alternative forms in the past and/or the future/“infinitive”. Unless one of 
them is in parentheses, these forms have almost equal status in speech.
• Some verbs are registered as two entries: The impersonal μπορεί differs from the personal 
μπορώ not only regarding meaning, but because the former has only present forms. On the 
other side the personal χρειάζομαι and the impersonal χρειάζεται are registered as one entry 
because of their almost identical meaning and because they both have past and future/“in -
finitive” forms.
• Some verbs seem to form their past and future/“infinitive” from their imperfective stem 
(compare ξέρω to ήξερα - θα/να ξέρω). For a full explanation, you will have to wait until 
levels B1-B2.
• Some “passive” verbs (such as γίνομαι, έρχομαι or κάθομαι) behave exactly like “active” 
verbs regarding the past and the future/“infinitive”. Other “passive” verbs (such as θυμάμαι, 
κοιμάμαι etc.) follow specific rules regarding the stem of the past and the future/“infini -
tive”. These rules are part of levels B1-B2, and definitely not your concern at the moment. 
Keep in mind, though, that all of them follow the inflectional model of the “active” past 
and future/“infinitive”.

GLOSSARY
The following text includes the basic terminology of this book with examples and brief expla-
nations (in italics when following an example).
1. Speaking and Writing
Human speech consists of sounds. These minimal units are put together to make larger units, 
such as words, phrases, clauses or sentences. As far as Modern Greek is concerned, these 
sounds are basically divided into vowels (1a) and consonants (1b):
(1a) [a], [e]
(1b) [pa], [ma]
V owels in Modern Greek can be assigned a stress, which makes them sound louder and longer 
than unstressed vowels. Stress is basically a property of words (2a) or phrases (2b):
(2a) [pote]  [pote]
 “when” (not) “ever”
(2b) [opetros / ine / apotinaθina] 
 “Peter is from Athens.”
Larger units are assigned additional features:
• Intonation covers the distinct melodic patterns that signal, for instance, the difference be-
tween making a statement (3a) and asking a question (3b):
(3a) [θeli paγοtο]
 “She/He wants ice cream.”
(3b) [θeli paγoto?]
 “ Does she/he want ice cream?”
• Focus is a sort of phonetic emphasis that highlights some part of the sentence in order to 
produce contrast:
(4) [O PETROS efaje ta psarja].
 “ It is Peter who ate the fish.”
When writing, sounds are represented by letters, as minimal units of the Greek alphabet (5a). 

--- Page 180 ---

GLOSSARY
Page 171
The stress in turn is represented by an accent mark (5b):
(5a) [pa] → πα
(5b) [pote] → πότε
Intonation is signaled by punctuation marks (6a). Finally, focus may be represented in vari -
ous ways (6b).
(6a) Θέλει παγωτό; 
(6b) Ο ΠΕΤΡΟΣ έφαγε τα ψάρια. / Ο Πέτρος έφαγε τα ψάρια.
2. Putting Words Together
Speaking is about conveying messages. The most elementary ones refer to an action, repre-
sented by a verb. The “ performer” of this action (usually a noun or a pronoun) functions as 
the subject of this verb:
(7) Εμείς παίζουμε. (“We play.”)
 SUBJ. VERB
The subject in Modern Greek may be optional (implicit), depending on the context (the sur-
rounding text and/or the assumptions that control its understanding):
(8) (O Πέτρος) παίζει.
• Peter is the obvious subject because he was mentioned earlier in the text.
• Peter is the obvious subject because I see him playing.
The action may affect something or be directed to someone (the direct or indirect object of 
the verb):
(9) Δίνω ένα βιβλίο στον Πέτρο. (“I am giving a book to Peter.”)
  DIR.OBJ. / INDIR.OBJ.
As far as Modern Greek is concerned, the subject, the verb and the object may hold various 
positions within the sentence. This is an instance of free word order:
(10a) Η Μαρία αγαπάει τον Πέτρο.
(10b) Τον Πέτρο αγαπάει η Μαρία.
 “Maria loves Peter.”
Nouns and verbs usually come together with other units that provide extra information about 

--- Page 181 ---

GLOSSARY
Page 172
them. These units are called modifiers. Modifiers depend either on a “head” noun as in 11a 
or on a “head” verb as in 11b:
(11a) Θέλω αυτόν τον ακριβό χάρτη.
 “I want this expensive map.”
(11b) Έρχεται αύριο.
 “She/He is coming tomorrow.”
3. Putting the Right Words Together
Modern Greek is an inflectional language. Inflected words (such as verbs and nouns) are pres-
ent in speech in different forms:
(12a) παίζω  παίζεις
 “I play” “you play”
(12b) δρόμος  δρόμοι
 “street” “streets”
Τhese different forms share a common left part (the stem) and a variable right part (the end-
ing):
(13a) δρόμος δρόμοι
(13b) παίζω παίζεις
Verbs are divided into two main inflectional groups according to voice (“active” vs. “pas -
sive”)
(14) πάω  έρχομαι
 “to come” “to go”
and are further inflected for person, number, tense and mood:
(15) παίζω
 “I play” / “I am playing”
• Person (1st): Τhe performer of the action is the speaker.
• Number (singular): The performer of the action is only one person.
• Tense (present): The action is being performed at the moment of speaking.
• Mood (Indicative): The action is seen as a fact.
Inflection does not stand alone in this field:

--- Page 182 ---

GLOSSARY
Page 173
• Modality is assigned by particles:
(16a) Αύριο θα παίξω.
 “Tomorrow I will play.”
(16b) Θέλω να παίξω.
 “I want to play.”
Both actions are not performed yet, therefore they are seen as non-facts.
• Aspect is assigned by the stem of the verb:
(17a) παίξαμε (“we played”)
(17b) παίζαμε (“we were playing”)
The action in 17a is seen as completed. The action in 17b is seen as not completed.
Nouns are divided into three groups according to gender:
(18) ο δρόμος η ώρα  το βιβλίο
The first noun is a masculine, the second is a feminine, and the third is a neuter.
and are further inflected for number
(19) δρόμος / δρόμοι
 “street” / “streets”
and case: Case is related to the actual syntactic role of a noun inside a sentence:
(20a) H Μαρία αγαπάει τον Πέτρο.
 “ Mary loves Peter.”
(20b) Ο Πέτρος αγαπάει την Μαρία.
 “Peter loves Mary.”
(20c) Ο άντρας της Μαρίας είναι από τον Καναδά.
 “ Mary’s husband is from Canada.”
Nominative: Mary of 20a is the subject.
Accusative: Mary of 20b is the object.
Genitive: Mary of 20c is a modifier, following the “head” noun.
The subject and the verb must agree in person and number; that is, they should share those 
grammatical features they have in common:

--- Page 183 ---

GLOSSARY
Page 174
(21) Εμείς παίζουμε.
The two terms agree in person (1st) and number (plural).
Agreement is a feature of the noun phrase as well: Modifiers of the noun (articles, adjectives, 
numerals) are inflected for gender, number and case in order to agree with the “head” noun.
(22) ακριβός αναπτήρας
The adjective ακριβός agrees in gender (masculine), number (singular) and case (nominative) 
with the “head” noun.
The same holds for pronouns, which must agree with the reference noun:
(23) Έχω έναν αδερφό, αλλά δεν τον βλέπω συχνά.
 “I have a brother, but I don’t see him often.”
The pronoun agrees in gender (masculine) and number (singular) with the reference noun. 
Case is taken up by the actual role of the pronoun within the sentence.
Modifiers of the verb (prepositions, adverbs) are not inflected. They come only in one form, 
so their choice depends on meaning alone. The same holds for particles and conjunctions.
4. Dealing with Meaning
Inflected words have an ordinary meaning (their lexical meaning), manifested by their stem. 
Their endings carry grammatical meaning:
(24) βιβλίο / βιβλία
Both words have the same lexical meaning (“book”) but their grammatical meaning is differ -
ent (singular vs. plural).
Lexical meaning is concrete, while grammatical meaning is abstract. Grammatical words 
such as articles and prepositions  are also carriers of abstract meaning:
(25a) Οι γάτες μισούν το νερό.
 “(All) cats hate water.”
(25b) Ο Γιάννης μένει με τον Πέτρο.
 “John lives with Peter.”
(25c) Έρχεται με το λεωφορείο.
 “She/He is coming by bus.”
The article in 25a gives the noun a definite generic reading. The different uses of the preposi -
tion in 25 b and c follow a single pattern that lies behind them.

--- Page 184 ---

GLOSSARY
Page 175
Lexical meaning is not a property of single words. Some words are usually taken together and 
have a single meaning, creating a periphrasis:
(26) Κάνω μπάνιο.
 “I swim.”
Meaning goes well beyond words to cover larger units. Sentences are assigned a meaning de -
pending on sentence type (affirmative, interrogative, negative):
(27a) Θέλει παγωτό.
 “She/He wants ice cream.”
(27b) Θέλει παγωτό;
 “ Does she/he want ice cream?”
(27c) Δεν θέλει παγωτό. / Θέλει να μην φάει παγωτό.
 “She/He doesn’t want ice cream”. “She’d rather not eat ice cream.”
The affirmative and the interrogative sentences (27a and 27b) differ only regarding intonation. 
Negation as in 27c is formed by particles.
Intonation, focus and the context play an important role here, since they determine the actual 
meaning of what is said.
(28a) Βρέχει.
(28b) Βρέχει…
An affirmative sentence can be taken as a simple statement in 28 a, and as irony in 28b.
Languages may differ in the way they structure meaning. Lexical asymmetries represent one 
of the most obvious cases of such differences:
(29a) Έχασα τα κλειδιά μου.
 “I lost my keys.”
(29b) Έχασα το λεωφορείο. 
 “I missed the bus.”
